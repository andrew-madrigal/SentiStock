1k54kj1,Badboyardie,The morning market indicator," Earnings Season Insights


Verizon (VZ): The telecom giant is set to report. Analysts are looking for stable growth in its infrastructure and continued expansion of its 5G network. A strong report could boost the entire telecom sector. Signal: Expect potentially positive premarket movement in the telecom sector, particularly if guidance is optimistic.

Tesla (TSLA): All eyes are on Tesla as it reports amid increased competition and concerns about production output. Market sentiment is highly sensitive to any news regarding production numbers and future guidance. Signal: Expect volatile premarket movement in the tech and automotive sectors. A negative report could drag down other EV stocks, while a positive report could fuel a broader tech rally.


VZ: A steady performance from Verizon could help to stabilize market sentiment, especially if it confirms the resilience of more traditional sectors.

TSLA: Given Tesla's high profile, its earnings report has the potential to dictate the direction of growth stocks in the near term. Disappointment could trigger a wider sell-off, while a strong showing could renew confidence in the growth narrative.


Federal Reserve Interest Rate Decision

The primary focus will be on any forward guidance provided by Fed speakers Harker, Kashkari, and Barkin. Their comments will be scrutinized for clues about the future path of monetary policy. Signal: Expect continued sideways movement in interest-rate-sensitive sectors as the market digests the implications of the Fed's stance.

Implications for Traders:

Markets are likely to be highly reactive to any hawkish or dovish signals from Fed officials. Strategy: Keep a close watch on fixed income markets and be prepared for quick shifts in asset allocation based on the Fed's commentary.



Geopolitical Events


Rising global tensions are adding to market uncertainty. Investors are closely monitoring geopolitical developments for any signs of escalation. Signal: Expect increased volatility and a potential flight to safety into assets like gold and U.S. Treasury bonds.


Performance Overview:

Top Performers: Energy (XLE) and Utilities (XLU) are showing relative strength as investors seek defensive positions. Signal: Strength in defensive sectors suggests a risk-off sentiment.

Underperformers: Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are underperforming as growth prospects are questioned. Signal: Weakness in growth-oriented sectors indicates concerns about future economic expansion.

Sector leaders: XLE, XLU

Sector laggards: XLK, XLY


S&P 500 
Key Levels:
https://flic.kr/p/2qZ6unn

Support: 5230, 4835 

Resistance: 5330, 5350

Technical Analysis:

SPY traded on lower volume, failing to reclaim 530 support. If the volume doesn't increase, it could correct to 500 or lower. If the volume increases, it could reclaim 520.

Money Flow Index (MFI): MFI is trending down at 51, indicating that inflow strength is waning, which is turning bearish. This suggests that buying pressure is decreasing.

Directional Movement Index (DMI): The +DI is trending downward, suggesting a possible weakening of the upward trend. This indicates that the bulls are losing momentum.

DMA (Displaced Moving Average): Price is still above the DMA, but this is weakening, which indicates a need to closely watch to see if it stays above these moving averages. A break below the DMA could signal a shift in trend.


SAVA CMO Retirement: The retirement of SAVA's CMO adds uncertainty to the company's leadership and future strategic direction.

DIS Analyst Upgrade: The analyst upgrade for Disney is a positive signal for the media and entertainment sector, suggesting potential for growth and increased profitability.

FTC vs. UBER: The FTC's lawsuit against Uber highlights regulatory headwinds for the ride-sharing industry and potential implications for its business practices.

CMG Mexico Expansion: Chipotle's plans to open locations in Mexico represent a growth opportunity in new markets, but also come with inherent risks.

Air India Boeing Deal: Air India's purchase of unsold Boeing jets is positive for the aerospace industry, but geopolitical factors and trade tensions remain a concern.

AMZN Downgrade (Raymond James): Raymond James' downgrade of Amazon reflects concerns over valuation, suggesting the stock may be overvalued at current levels.

Barclays Downgrades TSLA: Barclays' downgrade of Tesla highlights increased competition in the EV market and concerns about production and deliveries.


Best Sector Performance

Key Performers:

Utilities and Energy offer potential stability amid uncertainty, as these sectors are typically less sensitive to economic fluctuations. Signal: Look to add defensive positions.

Semiconductor Industry Opportunities

Quality companies with strong fundamentals in the semiconductor industry may present attractive entry points during market pullbacks. Signal: Monitor for entry points during pullbacks, but do your research on the underlying company first.

Banking Industry Opportunities

Analyst Sentiment:

Positive: 45%

Neutral: 35% 

Negative: 20%

* They need something concrete or the market reaction will continue to be like this. 
* Ukraine and Russia ceasefire over easter, still working on talks for permanent peace. US getting frustrated at lack of progress
* Talk and speculation on Pwoell's future continues. Bond market reflects the uncertainty here. Powell being fired would not be bullish as it undermines a lot about Fed independence
* Dollar is in the floor. This as a result of lack of confidence of foreign investors in US economy. Trade uncertainties continue.
* Equities lower also this morning as ar result of lack of concrete progress.
* So we have bond market, FX and equities all pointing to a lack of confidence in the US right now. 
* Gold ripping on economic uncertainty
* Earnings this week - TSLA and GOOGL to report.

1k629gb,stocks,"Change my mind: Holding cash is foolish, you should be DCAing","I can't believe I need to be saying this, but the discussions here in this subreddit has led me to believe I am being gaslit, people here are young investors with no notion of being long-term investors, or maybe I'm the  fool that's only been in the market for 8 years so I'm the guy who has no idea what I'm talking about. If it's the latter of the three, feel free to correct me.

For the past weeks I have seen so many people saying they are holding cash because they point out it's plainly and clearly obvious that in the coming months tariffs will finally take effect and that's when the true hurt will begin. The stock market is still overpriced. The V shape recovery after a crash is a lie this time! A true recession is where stocks will be down for years. Europe hasn't even retaliated yet. The true people who are 20+ aged investors and lived through 2008 know it's time to hold cash and wait. Even Warren Buffet is holding cash!

All pure speculation in my view. If I asked you right now what Trump's next move is, what Xi Jinping's next move it, if there will be a trade deal between USA and China, if Trump is backing down now due to advisors, can you answer any of these with certainty? Can you also tell me that when GOOG, NVDA, UBER, META, AMZN, XOM, etc all report earnings they will tank rather than go up and bring the markets up? Where exactly is the market bottom?

Just stop. Just like how today I can't tell you we are going back to a bull market with reaching ATH by the end of the year because we just had two massive days of rallies and Trump saying he is going to be soft on China with reports that his advisors were shitting the bed about the economy, you equally can't call the opposite about bull traps or whatever. What I can tell you is that you just missed a bunch of blue-chip stocks that were trading for one of their most undervalued prices ever. You should have been buying a week ago, you should be buying now, you should be DCAing stocks you have conviction in until they reach a price you believe is overvalued and you find a better opportunity in another. 

If you are an investor and stock holder, you are in this for the long-run. You are in this 10+ years. Even if your recession thesis plays out the market will recover. If you on the other hand are looking for a short-term, 10x my money in 2-3 years and retire, you're in the wrong place.

I find it pretty suspicious that when you attempt to find the Public Disclosure Reports for members of Congress, the pages cannot be found. I wonder why?

[It's not like they're all manipulating the stock market.](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/FinancialDisclosure)

Lucky for them, though, I was able to find some [for MTG](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2025/20029138.pdf)

I wonder how she was lucky enough to buy all of these on April 8th. Didn't Trump pause the tariffs on April 9th? Her financial advisor must be a psychic. He was so excited he didn't even check the box stating that she made more than $200 on the nearly 100,000 treasury bonds she sold

1k60nkb,ChartNavigators,Sector Spotlight,"The market is showing broad-based strength this week, with every major S&P 500 sector in the green. Let’s break down the top performers, highlight key trends, and spark discussion on what’s driving these moves and where investors might look next.
https://flic.kr/p/2qZoH4T



Financials (XLF) +3.31%  
Financials are leading the rally, climbing over 3% this week. Some of the top stocks driving this sector are likely major banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Consider potential catalysts like interest rate hikes and earnings reports.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +3.16%  
This sector is also outperforming, possibly thanks to strong retail sales data and upbeat guidance from leading consumer brands. Top stocks moving this sector include Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Home Depot (HD). Growth in travel, leisure, and luxury goods could be fueling the gains.

Utilities (XLU) +2.73%  
Utilities, typically considered a defensive play, are showing surprising strength. Key players in this sector include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK), and Southern Company (SO). This could signal a flight to safety amid broader market uncertainty.

Communication Services (XLC) +2.61%  
Big tech and media names are pushing this sector higher. Top stocks in this sector include Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Verizon (VZ). Look for catalysts like strong ad revenues and streaming growth.

Energy (XLE) +2.55%  
Energy stocks continue to benefit from firm oil prices and robust demand. Major companies influencing this sector include ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP). The sector’s gains may be tied to geopolitical developments or supply constraints.

Technology (XLK) +2.44%  
Tech is keeping pace with the broader market. Top stocks in tech include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). AI momentum, chip demand, and cloud growth remain key drivers.

Materials (XLB) +2.34%  
Materials are up, possibly on the back of commodity price strength and global infrastructure spending. Key stocks include Linde (LIN), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX). Chemical producers and miners could be leading the charge.

Real Estate (XLRE) +2.04%  
Real estate is rebounding, perhaps as investors hunt for value or respond to stabilizing interest rates. Top REITs in this sector include Prologis (PLD), American Tower (AMT), and Simon Property Group (SPG). REITs in logistics, data centers, and residential sectors may be worth watching.

Health Care (XLV) +1.88%  
Health care is positive but lagging the leaders. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Pfizer (PFE) are key stocks. This could reflect mixed earnings or shifting sentiment around drug pricing and regulation.

Industrials (XLI) +1.75%  
Industrials are gaining, potentially on strong manufacturing data or infrastructure tailwinds. Major players include United Parcel Service (UPS), Caterpillar (CAT), and Boeing (BA). Aerospace, defense, and transportation stocks might be driving the sector.

Consumer Staples (XLP) +1.42%  
Staples are up, but underperforming the rest of the market. Top consumer staple stocks include Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO), and Walmart (WMT). Investors may be rotating out of defensive names as risk appetite increases.



 Which sector do you think will keep its momentum next week?
 Are there specific stocks in these outperforming sectors you’re watching or trading?
 What macro trends—like inflation, rates, or earnings—do you think are shaping sector performance right now?
 For those bullish on Financials or Energy, what’s your thesis? For those cautious on Staples or Industrials, what’s your concern?

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-05-30.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",best options sell expiring days,highest premium options offer highest ratio implied volatility iv relative historical volatility hv options priced move significantly moved past sell iron condors may priced stockcp change direction put call put premium call premium er beta efficiency lqd na uso na hyg na tlt na xle na nke na slv na wpm na dal na ntr na expensive calls call options offer highest ratio bullish premium paid iv relative historical volatility hv options priced expecting underlying move significantly moved past sell calls stockcp change direction put call put premium call premium er beta efficiency uso na slv na xle na nke na wpm na ual na tlt na ntr na lqd na dal na expensive puts put options offer highest ratio bearish premium paid iv relative historical volatility hv options priced expecting underlying move significantly moved past sell puts stockcp change direction put call put premium call premium er beta efficiency hyg na lqd na tlt na uso na nke na xle na dal na wpm na kmi na aa na historical move v implied move determine historical volatility standard deviation daily log returns underlying asset compare current implied volatility iv option price use dte look back period used determine call put premium associated pricing options implied volatility directional bias ranges negative bearish positive bullish accounts rsi price trend moving averages putcall skew past weeks priced move given current option prices much dollar amounts underlying move make callput break even much vol option pricing expected move expiration callput premium much extra paying implied move relative historic move low numbers mean options cheaper high numbers mean options expensive efficiency factor represents bidask spreads depth order book relative price option represents much traders pay slippage round trip trade lower numbers less efficient higher numbers er days unitl next earnings release feature still beta work complete list earnings dates isnt stock list doesnt weeklies underlying cheap options markets illiquid open interest qualify strategy underlyings used report top results end passing criteria filter,1.0,,['NKE'],negative,0.9999759,negative,0.9828360676765442

1k3xfct,u_TradingAllIn,Briefing for Monday and the upcoming week in US markets,"# Market Summary & Outlook - Week of April 21, 2025

**Overall TL;DR:**

>Markets enter the week cautious after recent tariff-induced volatility. Focus shifts to a heavy earnings slate (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META) and key economic data (Flash PMIs, GDP, PCE inflation). Ongoing US-China trade tensions and Middle East geopolitical risks remain significant background concerns, impacting oil, tech, and safe-haven assets. Fed commentary remains data-dependent amidst conflicting signals from recent economic reports.

# Weekend News Summary and Assessment (Primarily April 19-20, 2025)

**TL;DR:**

>Trade policy uncertainty persists as the major overhang, while Middle East tensions simmer, potentially impacting oil. No major new Fed signals emerged over the weekend. Congress averted an immediate shutdown, pushing funding deadlines to September.

* **Political Developments:**
   * **Trump's Tariff Policies:** Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's recent imposition of broad tariffs remains the dominant theme driving market volatility and global economic growth concerns. While some exemptions were noted previously, the overall policy stance keeps trade relations tense, particularly with China. Existing high tariffs on specific items like Chinese EVs and solar panels add to the complex trade landscape. Rumors of potential new sanctions targeting Chinese tech firms persist amid these tensions.
   * **Investor Sentiment:** The unpredictable nature of trade policy continues to foster caution, with some analyses noting reduced investor confidence in US assets and lower economic approval ratings for the administration linked to tariff impacts.
   * **Middle East Escalation:** Ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza and reported Iran-backed group activity continue. While no major weekend escalation significantly shifted oil markets pre-open, the situation remains tense, supporting oil prices and demand for safe-haven assets like gold. OPEC+ continues monitoring the situation.
   * **China-Taiwan Tensions:** Naval exercises were noted, keeping this geopolitical flashpoint relevant background noise.
   * **US Government Funding:** Congress passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) in March, funding the government through September 30, 2025. This removes the immediate threat of a shutdown but sets the stage for FY 2026 budget negotiations later this year.
* **Global Economic News:** China's Q1 GDP (reported previously) met expectations. Bank of Japan officials continue signaling potential rate normalization. Recent softer UK inflation data keeps BOE policy options open. Weaker German industrial data highlights European growth challenges.
* **US Macro News:**
   * **Inflation Data:** Last week's March CPI data showed a slight cooling (Headline 3.4%, Core 3.6%), initially boosting hopes for a Fed pause/cut. Focus now shifts intensely to this Friday's March PCE Price Index (the Fed's preferred measure) for confirmation.
   * **Retail Sales:** Weak March retail sales data (reported last week) contrasted with prior strong readings and a relatively robust labor market, adding complexity to the economic picture and softening the ""higher-for-longer"" Fed narrative for some.
   * **Fed Speakers:** No major new signals emerged over the weekend. Recent comments (Williams, Bostic, Powell last week) reiterated a ""data-dependent"" stance, acknowledging tariff impacts, showing little urgency to cut rates but also deeming further hikes unlikely *at this moment*. The Fed remains watchful of incoming data, particularly inflation.

# Last Week's Major Items and Impact on Upcoming Week

**TL;DR:**

>Tariff whiplash dominated last week, leading to lower index closes despite intra-week volatility. Mixed economic data (cooler CPI, weak retail) fuels Fed policy debate. Earnings season begins, with upcoming reports crucial for market direction.

* **Tariff Turmoil:** The primary driver was the market digesting Trump's tariff actions and China's retaliations. This volatility is expected to persist, with sensitivity to any new trade headlines.
* **Economic Data Dichotomy:** Softer CPI and weak retail sales data boosted rate cut speculation, countered by underlying wage pressures and a still-tight labor market. This week's GDP and PCE data will be critical in shaping the Fed narrative.
* **Earnings Season Kickoff:** Initial earnings were mixed. The upcoming week features a high concentration of influential reports, which will heavily dictate sector and overall market performance.
* **Market Action:** Major indices (SPY, DIA) closed lower for the week, while small caps (IWM) showed relative strength. Gold (GLD) rallied strongly, oil (USO) gained, and bonds (AGG) saw mild selling.

# Impact of Weekend News on Monday Market Open

**TL;DR:**

>Expect a cautious open. Relief from lack of major weekend shocks may be offset by ongoing trade uncertainty and anticipation of key earnings/data. Middle East tensions support oil/energy, while US-China friction pressures tech.

* Ongoing Middle East tensions likely provide continued support for oil prices (WTI, Brent) and energy stocks (XLE). Safe-haven demand for gold (XAU/USD) may persist.
* Persistent US-China trade and tech tensions could weigh on semiconductor (SMH, SOXX) and China-related stocks (KWEB, MCHI).
* Avoiding a government shutdown provides near-term stability but isn't a major bullish catalyst.
* Focus will rapidly shift to Tuesday's Flash PMIs and key earnings like TSLA. Futures (ES\_F, NQ\_F) direction pre-market will be indicative.

# Stocks, ETFs, Commodities, Futures, and Expected Impact

**TL;DR:**

>Tech earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META) are pivotal. Energy and Defense may benefit from geopolitics. Gold remains a key safe haven. Watch Treasuries react to inflation data (PCE).

* **Stocks:**
   * **Energy** (XOM, CVX, SLB, HAL, OXY, MPC, APA, DVN, FANG, COP, PSX): Potential upside from geopolitical risk premium, OPEC+ vigilance.
   * **Defense** (LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, LHX): May benefit from global tensions.
   * **Technology** (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, INTC, GOOGL, META, SMCI, AVGO, AMAT, LRCX, QCOM, ON, KLAC, TEAM, HUBS): High focus on earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META). Sensitive to US-China tensions. NVDA earnings (likely later) still cast a shadow. GOOGL also watched for antitrust news.
   * **Retail/Consumer** (TGT, WMT, HD, COST, MCD, KO, NKE, PTON, ETSY, COTY, XLY, XLP): Earnings and outlooks key for gauging consumer health.
   * **Financials** (JPM, BAC, WFC, GS, CMA, BOH, KRE, KBE, COF, XLF, HBAN): Focus on earnings, net interest margin outlooks. Regionals (KRE) remain under scrutiny.
   * **Industrials** (CAT, GE, BA, MMM, DE, HON, XLI): Sensitive to trade, economic cycle. Key earnings due (GE, BA, LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, MMM).
   * **Chinese ADRs** (BABA, PDD, NIO, LI, BIDU, JD, TCEHY, YUMC, NTES): Vulnerable to tariffs and geopolitical friction.
   * **Healthcare** (UNH, LLY, MRK, BMY, ABBV, HCA, ELV, MOH, HUM, CNC, CVS): Sector rotation, drug pipelines, earnings (MRK, BMY, ABBV, HCA) are key.
   * **Semiconductors** (NVDA, AMD, INTC, SMH, SOXX, AVGO, AMAT, LRCX, QCOM, ON, KLAC): Volatile; key earnings (INTC), demand outlook, China tensions.
   * **Other notables:** LLY (drug news), PYPL (payments), ENPH (solar), DAL, AAL, LUV (airlines), LEN, DHI (housing), ADM, BG, CF, CMP, IPI, MOS (agriculture/chemicals).
* **ETFs:**
   * **Broad Market** (SPY, QQQ, DIA, IWM, IUXX, SPX): Reflecting overall sentiment.
   * **Sector Specific** (XLE, USO, OIH, XLI, XLB, XLK, XLU, XLC, XLY, XLP, XLF, XRT, KBE, KRE): Tracking sector performance.
   * **Thematic/International** (SMH, SOXX, KWEB, MCHI, REMX, EZU): Following specific themes/regions.
   * **Bonds** (TLT, AGG, IEF, SHY): Reacting to inflation, Fed expectations, flight-to-safety.
   * **Volatility** (VIX, VXX): Sensitive to uncertainty, data surprises.
   * **Commodity** (GLD, IAU, SLV, GDX, CPER, DBA, WEAT, OIL): Tracking underlying commodity moves.
* **Commodities:**
   * **Crude Oil** (WTI, Brent, CL\_F): Supported by Middle East risk, watch inventories. Key resistance/support levels watched.
   * **Gold** (XAU/USD, GC\_F, GLD): Key safe haven; sensitive to yields, dollar (DXY), geopolitics. Holding above 2,400 is constructive. Miners (NEM, AEM, GOLD, GDX, AU) may leverage gains.
   * **Copper** (HG\_F, CPER): Global growth proxy, sensitive to China and trade.
   * **Silver** (XAG/USD, SLV): Following precious metals trend, industrial demand component.
   * **Agricultural** (WEAT, DBA, Wheat, Corn, Soybeans): Geopolitics (Ukraine), weather, supply chains are factors. Wheat (WEAT) potential breakout near 6.50/bu noted.
* **Futures:**
   * **Index Futures** (ES\_F, NQ\_F, YM\_F, ESM25, NQM25): Real-time direction; watching technical levels (e.g., S&P 4,800 support mentioned previously).
   * **VIX Futures** (VX\_F): Forward volatility expectations.
   * **Treasury Futures** (ZN\_F, ZB\_F, ZNM25): Interest rate and inflation expectations.

# Crypto Summary

**TL;DR:**

>Relatively stable weekend for majors (BTC \~$84.5k-$85k). Focus may shift to potential SEC decisions on spot ETH ETFs this week.

* Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) showed minor fluctuations over the weekend. Other majors like Litecoin (LTC) and XRP (XRP) saw modest moves.
* Regulatory watch: Potential SEC updates on spot Ethereum ETFs could be a catalyst. News about Schwab's spot trading plans and potential US gov't Bitcoin reserves also percolating.
* Crypto-related stocks (COIN, MSTR, MARA) and ETFs (BITO) remain highly correlated to BTC price action.

# Legal Summary

**TL;DR:**

>Google's antitrust issues remain a focus. Broader tariff uncertainty is the main legal/political overhang. No major Supreme Court tech liability ruling expected this week.

* The Google (GOOGL) ad tech monopoly ruling continues to be relevant. Ongoing DOJ antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech (GOOGL, AMZN) persists.
* The dominant legal/political factor impacting markets remains the uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and tariffs.
* Previous major Supreme Court rulings on tech platform liability (Section 230) occurred in 2023, largely maintaining the status quo. No similar landmark decision is imminent this week.

# Highest Expected Volatility Items

**TL;DR:**

>Tech earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META), US GDP & PCE data, Fed speak (Powell Wed), and any significant tariff/geopolitical developments are the top volatility drivers.

* **Key Earnings Releases:** TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META guidance/results.

* **Geopolitics:** Middle East developments impacting oil (WTI, Brent) and risk sentiment.

1k2k35j,ValueInvesting,"Review my stock list for ""Tradewar Crash Reversals""","I created a screener for stocks that have recently (\~1mo-30mo) fallen by a large amount, but still have good financials. I am not a great investor, and would love some opinions oh why these stocks could be a good choice short term, or are a bad choice.

Already, digging into these companies further most of these do not look like great long term plays. But that is not my goal, instead, a ""swing"" trade for 1-2 years under the assumption the macro economy improves and the market in general returns to some form of normalcy.

I understand completely that we could continue to fall, and things could get a lot worse. But as a ""value-investor"" I believe I am looking for companies that are trading below fair value, and can potentially see a reversal. I believe the current state of the market has increased the number of these opportunities, and I believe these may be some of them. Tell me why I am wrong, what I didn't search for in my screener, and why the companies I chose are good options or garbage. I mostly want to see if my thoughts on the companies are accurate, and if the screener I setup is inline with what I should be looking for in terms of finding undervalued companies.

First, let's start with the screener:

1. Exchange: NYSE, NASDAQ
2. Average Volume (10day): 1M->50M
3. Market Cap: 2B->2T
4. P/E: <30
5. P/S (FY):<5
6. Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM): <20
7. Enterprise Value/EBITDA (TTM): <15
8. Free Cash Flow Margin (TTM): ≥0
9. Yearly Performance: Between -50%--20%

This resulted in around \~70 companies. Honestly, I didn't feel like digging through every single one so I mostly looked at their price charts for the last decade and made sure it wasn't trading too flat. I came down to 11 companies, which are:

1. $DECK
2. $IQV
3. $TGT
4. $GPN
5. $NKE
6. $ON
7. $MKSI
8. $FDX
9. $NBIX
10. $GNRC
11. $TTC

My goal is to refine this list down to 5 or so, and do further research from there. (unfortunately while producing this list I noticed $GPN got obliterated the other day due to an acquisition so that may change inclusion of that one)

Out of this list, the top five I am interested in are:

1. $DECK
2. $IQV
3. $TGT
4. $ON
5. $NKE

SBUX is up 2.4% today following analyst ratings 100-106 by Barclays, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. This company will be heavily impacted by tarriffs as your expensive beans don’t come from your grandpas farm in Kansas. If there’s an economic slowdown the first thing to go will be your 7$ cup of coffee on the way to work because you lost your job. Higher labor costs for the company caused by unions will continue to be a drag. Maxwell beans going to be selling like hotcakes as people look for cheaper coffee at DG. The bright spot is oil is cheap so the actual shipping cost may be less. 

Technicals

50 day ema crossed the 200 this week. 50 day  ema crossed 90 last week. Large outflows even on up days such as today. The stock is up about 2.4% right now and large order flow of sells is 2.92 million and buy sits around 1.5 million. If you’re into math that’s about 50% difference. The big guys are selling and the retailers buying 24.6 mil vs selling 21.8 mil. May find some support around 74.

1k02dze,DailyStockSpotlight,"Today’s stock winners and losers - HPE, Netflix, Bank of America, Boeing, Allegro MicroSystems & Applied Digital","# Stock winners



**⬆︎5.11% Hewlett Packard Enterprise**

**Activist investor Elliott Management just took a $1.5 billion stake in the server maker. HPE has had a rough stretch with weak results. Elliott, which has a track record of shaking things up at underperforming companies, plans to push for changes aimed at boosting the company’s value. (**[**The Globe and Mail**](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/SBUX-Q/pressreleases/31897592/hewlett-packard-enterprise-hpe-stock-rises-7-as-elliott-management-takes-15-billion-stake/)**)**



**⬆︎4.83% Netflix**

**The streaming giant wants in on the trillion-dollar club. At an internal business review meeting, Netflix execs said they’re aiming for a $1 trillion valuation by 2030. How? By growing their subscriber base, especially in India and Brazil, and doubling down on its ad business. Curious who the seven members of the club are? Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Saudi Aramco. (**[**WSJ**](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/netflix-aims-to-join-the-1-trillion-club-fdacb250)**)**



**⬆︎3.60% Bank of America**

**🛎️ Earnings report - Solid start to the year, thanks to strong loan profits and a good quarter in trading. CEO Brian Moynihan said consumers are still spending and credit quality looks healthy, but the bank is keeping things cautious as the economic outlook gets shakier. Investment banking took a hit, with fewer deals happening amid all the trade drama. (**[**CNBC**](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/15/bank-of-america-bac-earnings-q1-2025.html)**)**



# Stock losers



⬇︎**2.36%** **Boeing**

**Boeing is facing new headwinds in China.** Beijing has reportedly told Chinese airlines to stop accepting new Boeing deliveries and to avoid buying aircraft parts from U.S. companies. The move adds pressure as U.S.-China trade tensions heat up. ([IBD](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-stock-china-tariffs-trade-wars-president-trump-jet-orders/))



⬇︎**9.68%** **Allegro MicroSystems**

**Chipmaker Onsemi has officially pulled its $6.9 billion bid to buy Allegro MicroSystems**, a company that makes power and sensor circuits. Onsemi said it still believes the merger made sense but decided to walk away after Allegro’s board refused to fully engage. Allegro had previously called the offer “inadequate.” ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/allegro-microsystems-stock-slumps-as-onsemi-pulls-nearly-usd7b-acquisition-offer-11715295))



⬇︎**35.94%** **Applied Digital**

**🛎️ Earnings report - From crypto, to AI, to… real estate?** The bitcoin mining turned data center company missed revenue targets after its Cloud Services unit took a hit by switching to a new GPU rental model. The company now plans to sell that business and focus fully on high-performance computing and data centers, with long-term plans to possibly become a REIT. ([Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-digital-tumbles-30-revenue-151122952.html))

1jwz8m2,StockMarket,"Week Recap: The stock market had passed a highly volatile week and ended positive both daily and weekly. Is the worst behind us? Apr. 4, 2025 - Apr. 11, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Apr. 4 to Apr. 11. 

I had the same question that ""Is the worst behind us?"" in March 15. The S&P 500 closed 5,638.94 that week. And today, it has closed at 5,358.75. But this time, could it be different?

It has been a busy week, and also a highly volatile one. The S&P500's daily closing percentages were -0.23%, -1.57%, +9.52%, -3.46%, +1.72%.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: Last week, we saw major losses after the tariff announcements. Asian markets opened with heavy selling pressure. The Hang Seng Index dropped 13% in a single day. Thailand temporarily banned short selling of stocks. This week started under similar pressure. Althouth there was no major news for the market, but it rebounded and recovered more than 3% its loses. The day ended slightly negative. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, ""Up to 70 nations want to negotiate over Trump's tariffs"". This boosted the market and opened up by around 2.5%. However, the momentum could not continue. The White House later announced that Trump is not considering any extensions or delays. All gains were erased and the market dropped more than 1.5% 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Here we go. The stock market opened slightly lower and then came big news. Trump signaled a 90-day pause on tariffs, but China's tariff rate will jump to 125%. The stock market focused on the first part and made a huge jump and gained more than 10%. What a day. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: CPI inflation was released and came in below expectations, but investors remembered China's tarrifs and took profits. The stock market lost more than 3%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: PPI inflation had released and similar to CPI, it came below expectations. The monthly expectation was 0.2%, but it came -0.4%. This result caused to the yearly rate to drop to 2.7%. The yearly dropped below 3% since November 2024. This is very positive for the stock market because it increases the chances of more rate cuts. The first one could come in May, but prohability is still low. On the negative side, The US10Y (10-year treasury) hit 4.60 and the highest level since Feb. 13. The stock market is expecting the first rate cut in June. The last day of the week ended on a positive. 🟢

On Monday, the S&P 500 hit its lowest level of this week at 4,835.04. Was that the dip? I saw a tariff alert on a news app on Wednesday and I bought around 5150.

1k5wwyl,Bai_Lu,yu zheng's comments on bai lu's dubbing in feud (translation in comments),"# pic 1

lin jiang xian is my first xianxia drama, and also the least ""xianxia-like"" xianxia drama. The process of making it was exhilarating, because we tried many new methods and technologies. Whether it's the long drama presented in a short-drama format, or the innovations in audiovisual techniques, we hope to give the audience a completely different experience. That’s why my trailer doesn’t contain spoilers, the most beautiful visuals are always kept within the drama, and the story itself is full of mystery — the answers are meant to be discovered through watching the show. There’s no grand worldview, no “fate of the world,” no tortured love spanning lifetimes, and no episodic leads — just an incredibly captivating “war between a married couple.”

Lulu and joseph deliver performances completely different from anything they’ve done before. You won’t see any traces of their past acting styles in this show. I’ve watched the editing and music scoring process many times, and I still get pulled into tears and laughter by their acting. Honestly, no amount of explanation can beat the show airing and letting the audience judge for themselves. Just look forward to it — especially in a time when xianxia is the most underestimated genre. Let’s see how I carve out a bloody path.

# pic 2

user: hua ru yue and li qing yue have different voices?

YZ: different. the trailer didnt have hua ru yue's voice

# pic 3

user: the VA doesnt really suit the character, can it be changed?

YZ: it has already been changed, it's liu xiaoyu

# pic 4

*responding to a user saying isnt it cui shiyi's VA like he said previously?* YZ: After hearing both actors, I made a more suitable change. What's all this about believing or not believing? It's about constantly making adjustments for the sake of the drama. do i not fix it if there's a problem? I really don't understand how some of your minds work.

# pic 5

user: the female VA should be qiao shiyu, she dubbed for legends, it can plus points for bai lu. she can change her voice according to hua ru yue and li qing yue. A: qiao shi yu, B: bai lu's voice. using dubbing now really minuses alot of points

YZ: the dubbing now is great, i like it alot. I won’t give up on what I love just because you don’t like it—so give up already!

# pic 6

user: Can we please get rid of the bright white filter? In xianxia dramas, harsh white lighting is a big no-no. Remove the fog effect, tone down the white light, lower the color temperature, and reduce color saturation.

YZ: This drama didn’t use any filters — the director shot it so beautifully, why would we need filters at all?

# pic 7

user: This voice-over doesn’t match the lively and charming image I imagined for xiao shimei (little junior sister) It sounds too deep and heavy. Can it still be adjusted? 

YZ: Who told you she’s lively and charming? She’s a quiet, almost invisible character — timid and hesitant. How is that lively? Who told you she’s supposed to be lively?

# pic 8

user: Fans have their own 'filters' — but this voice-over just doesn’t fit. Li should be lively, but also modest and reserved, not flashy. this is such a great drama, can we please get a better voice for Li Qingyue?

YZ: You say that like you’ve read the script or something.

# pic 9

user: your shows are all good, im waiting

YZ: My drama is destined to be a dark horse. Before it airs, it's either completely silent or full of storms and chaos—but once it's out, it shuts up. I don’t want to buy/hype stocks, I don’t want thunder without rain. I just want to quietly amaze everyone. A trailer is just a trailer. It won’t give away too much—otherwise, if you get all the spoilers from the preview, who’s still going to follow the series?

# pic 10

user: i thought we will be using shiyi's VA? why is it not liu qing (*the VA*)?

YZ: i've tried, she's good too but what I want is an unnoticed disciple in the sect so liu xiaoyu is better",yu zhengs comments bai lus dubbing feud translation comments,pic lin jiang xian first xianxia drama also least xianxialike xianxia drama process making exhilarating tried many new methods technologies whether long drama presented shortdrama format innovations audiovisual techniques hope give audience completely different experience thats trailer doesnt contain spoilers beautiful visuals always kept within drama story full mystery answers meant discovered watching show theres grand worldview fate world tortured love spanning lifetimes episodic leads incredibly captivating war married couple lulu joseph deliver performances completely different anything theyve done wont see traces past acting styles show ive watched editing music scoring process many times still get pulled tears laughter acting honestly amount explanation beat show airing letting audience judge look forward especially time xianxia underestimated genre lets see carve bloody path pic user hua ru yue li qing yue different voices yz different trailer didnt hua ru yues voice pic user va doesnt really suit character changed yz already changed liu xiaoyu pic responding user saying isnt cui shiyis va like said previously yz hearing actors made suitable change whats believing believing constantly making adjustments sake drama fix theres problem really dont understand minds work pic user female va qiao shiyu dubbed legends plus points bai lu change voice according hua ru yue li qing yue qiao shi yu b bai lus voice using dubbing really minuses alot points yz dubbing great like alot wont give love dont like itso give already pic user please get rid bright white filter xianxia dramas harsh white lighting big nono remove fog effect tone white light lower color temperature reduce color saturation yz drama didnt use filters director shot beautifully would need filters pic user voiceover doesnt match lively charming image imagined xiao shimei little junior sister sounds deep heavy still adjusted yz told shes lively charming shes quiet almost invisible character timid hesitant lively told shes supposed lively pic user fans filters voiceover doesnt fit li lively also modest reserved flashy great drama please get better voice li qingyue yz say like youve read script something pic user shows good im waiting yz drama destined dark horse airs either completely silent full storms chaosbut shuts dont want buyhype stocks dont want thunder without rain want quietly amaze everyone trailer trailer wont give away muchotherwise get spoilers preview whos still going follow series pic user thought using shiyis va liu qing va yz ive tried shes good want unnoticed disciple sect liu xiaoyu better,1.0,Yuzheng's comments 🗨️,['LULU'],negative,0.9996846,negative,0.999891996383667

1k4npx3,thestallionvibe,"Navigating the $TSLA, $NVDA, and $AMZN Rollercoaster: Market Trends and Strategies","The financial markets are currently navigating a complex landscape, influenced by political rhetoric, economic policy concerns, and a broad sense of unease. This post aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current market trends, potential trading and investing signals, and actionable strategies to navigate these challenging conditions.

Market Trends and Stock Index Performance

Index Performance

The S&P 500 has seen significant volatility, with a notable drop in recent sessions, indicating bearish sentiment driven by political uncertainties and economic policy concerns. The 52-week range is 4835.04 - 6147.43, with a market day high of 5232.94 and a previous close of 5282.7.

The NASDAQ Composite has experienced a decline, reflecting broader market concerns. The tech-heavy index's performance is often a bellwether for investor sentiment in growth stocks. The 52-week range is 14784.03 - 20204.58, with a market day high of 16066.792 and a previous close of 16286.447.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has seen a sharp decline, with over 900 points lost in a single session, likely due to renewed investor worries stemming from political rhetoric and economic policy uncertainties. The 52-week range is 36611.78 - 45073.63, with a market day high of 38906.04 and a previous close of 39142.23.

Commodities and Currencies

Gold prices have been on the rise, indicating a flight to safety as investors seek refuge from market volatility. The 52-week range is 2277.6 - 3442.3, with a market day high of 3442.3 and a previous close of 3328.4.

Oil has shown some stability, but the broader market sentiment could impact future price movements. Geopolitical tensions and supply-demand dynamics will be key factors to watch. The 52-week range is 55.12 - 84.52, with a market day high of 64.42 and a previous close of 64.68.

The US Dollar has been relatively stable, but any significant shifts in monetary policy or geopolitical events could lead to volatility. The 52-week range is 97.921 - 110.18, with a market day high of 99.208 and a previous close of 99.376.

Bitcoin has seen significant volatility, reflecting its sensitivity to broader market sentiment and regulatory developments. The 52-week range is 49121.24 - 109114.88, with a market day high of 88404.57 and a previous close of 85169.61.

Overall Market Sentiment

There appears to be a general sense of unease in the market, with concerns about rising political and economic uncertainty contributing to a broad selloff in risk assets. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China are weighing on investor sentiment across various sectors. Speculations regarding who will succeed Fed Chair Powell add another layer of uncertainty.

Potential Trading and Investing Signals

Risk Aversion: The rise in gold prices and the decline in major indices suggest a shift towards risk aversion. Investors may want to consider defensive sectors or assets that typically perform well during market downturns.

Volatility: The sharp declines in major indices indicate increased market volatility. Traders might look for opportunities in options trading or other strategies that can benefit from heightened volatility.

Economic Policy Uncertainty: Political rhetoric and economic policy concerns are driving market sentiment. Investors should stay informed about any developments in this area, as they could lead to further market movements.

Sector Rotation: With growth stocks under pressure, there may be opportunities in value stocks or sectors that are less sensitive to interest rate changes and economic policy shifts.

Diversification: Given the current market conditions, diversification across asset classes and sectors could help mitigate risk. Investors might consider adding exposure to commodities, bonds, or other alternative investments.

Safe-Haven Assets: The rise in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) could indicate a flight to safety, with investors seeking to reduce risk.

Options Activity: Unusual options activity in stocks like Lululemon Athletica (LULU), and Workday (WDAY) might signal potential shifts in investor sentiment.

Short Interest: Changes in short interest for stocks like Elanco Animal Health (ELAN), Carvana (CVNA), and LTC Properties (LTC) could provide insights into market expectations.

Tariff Sensitivity: Companies with significant exposure to tariffs, particularly those reliant on Chinese imports or exports, may experience increased volatility.

Banking Consolidation: The Capital One-Discover merger could pave the way for more deals in the sector.

Fintech Disruption: Circle’s new payments network and CSI’s AI-driven AML solution highlight innovation in fintech.

Income Opportunities: Bond ETFs like Invesco BulletShares remain attractive for income-focused investors.

Regulatory Risks: Increased SEC and FTC actions could impact corporate practices and compliance costs.

AI Growth: Continued advancements in AI present opportunities but also regulatory challenges for tech giants.

Stocks and Sectors to Watch

Technology: Keep an eye on Alphabet (Google), Apple, and Meta. Alphabet appears to be viewed as more resilient in an uncertain macro environment. Watch for potential impact from investigations into Meta.

Retail: Walmart and Target are in focus due to discussions with the government regarding tariffs.

Consumer Goods: Monitor PepsiCo (PEP) due to political and tariff risks.

Financials: Financial stocks like American Express (AXP), Blackstone (BX), and Ally Financial (ALLY) experienced declines.

EV: Watch Tesla (TSLA) for production delays and Rivian (RIVN) for policy uncertainty.

Rare Earth Materials: Monitor MP Materials (MP) amid rising trade tensions.

Real Estate: LTC Properties (LTC) has seen an increase in short interest, suggesting a potentially bearish outlook from some investors.

Restaurants: Tariff pressures could reshape restaurant buildout economics, impacting companies like Wingstop (WING), Sweetgreen (SG), and Cava Group (CAVA).

Ford Motor Company (F): Watch for a potential yield trap.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A promising stock to add to watch, as its earnings have been strong and the company has a history of innovation and growth.

High Growth Momentum Stocks

Copart, Inc. (CPRT): Significant market cap. High P/E ratio suggests a premium valuation. Watch for continued growth to justify the current price.

Lantheus Holdings Inc (LNTH): Relatively lower P/E ratio compared to Copart.

Stride Inc (LRN): Relatively lower P/E ratio compared to Copart.

Bearish Sentiment and Potential Risks

TSLA (Tesla): Concerns about the company's future, including potential bankruptcy and the impact of a new CEO, are prevalent.

NVDA (Nvidia): There is a belief that the AI bubble is starting to pop, which could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.

AMZN (Amazon) & MSFT (Microsoft): Economic concerns are reflected in paused data center lease commitments and slowed build-outs.

WMT (Walmart), HD (Home Depot), LOW (Lowe's), TGT (Target): These retailers are expected to face substantial hits to their profit margins due to tariffs.

Several articles mention investigations by Pomerantz Law Firm into various companies (RH, Affirm, Xponential Fitness, Pony AI, HealthEquity, OSI Systems), which could indicate potential risks.

Actionable Strategies

Diversify Your Portfolio: Spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to mitigate risk.

Consider Defensive Sectors: Focus on sectors that are less sensitive to economic downturns, such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities.

Monitor Economic Indicators: Keep a close eye on key economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates.

Stay Informed on Policy Changes: Be aware of any changes in government policies, regulations, and trade agreements that could impact the markets.

Manage Risk: Use stop-loss orders and other risk management tools to protect your investments.

Consider Income-Generating Assets: Explore opportunities in bond ETFs and dividend-paying stocks to generate income in a volatile market.

Conclusion

The current financial market environment is characterized by heightened volatility, risk aversion, and economic uncertainty. By staying informed, adapting your investment strategies, and managing risk effectively, you can navigate these challenging conditions and position your portfolio for long-term success. Remember to consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

1k1dev9,CharlotteDobreYouTube,AITAH for going off on my MIL for making my daughter cry and forcing my daughter and niece to wait outside for my SIL to pick them up?,"For some context this situation happened April 7th and in the last couple of days my daughter showed me hers and my niece's conversation. Apparently my SIL's bf has alot to say about the matter now.  (Do not have screenshots of those particular messages. Just the ones from the day of the incident)

Back story:

My husband (Sessy 33m) and I (34f) have been married 8.5 years, and back together for 8.5 years lol I know what yall must be thinking... WHAT?! 

Pretty much when we were alot younger,  late teens we got together I already had a son but his father was absent so my husband (then boyfriend) stepped up and helped me raise him. I got pregnant with our first son. 

We had split up do to alot of family drama from his side (his brother had pretty much raised my bf at that point and held alot over his head). While we were separated he had other kids , I had other kids.  

He was in a really toxic relationship , I was in an abusive relationship.. him and I were no contact except for random spurts of ""I should've never left you periods"" we would have behind our partners back at the time.  It was never physical cheating but to me it was emotional cheating for sure. 

Neither of us had known it in the moment but going through the home lives we were , we had both been in active addiction. From the time we originally broke up we hadn't seen each other for almost 5 years.  He moved to a different state got himself clean.  

My abusive relationship got explosive, and it all came to a head.  I thought he was going to unalive me.  I was beaten and bruised. I was a shell of a woman. 
I was thinking with every line that laid in front of me my kids would be better without me and hoped the next time I did a rail I wouldn't wake back up.  I was broken. 

My second son's dad (Now husband) randomly reached out on Facebook, said how much he had missed us over the years,  he finally got away from his ex for good and got his life together to be able to come back to us a better man. But I was broken he just didn't know it yet.  

He came to visit the next weekend seen the shape I was in and offered me an out. Without hesitation I took it.  Packed a couple duffle bags of kids clothes and hit the road.  That was December 23 2016 we got married January 10 2017. I've been 8 years clean thanks to this man and my kiddos. 

Now the details that mostly matter.. I have 5 kids my second son and my youngest son is my husband's biological children. But he has raised all of my children as his own.  Treats none of them differently and will defend them til the death of him doesn't matter who it is.  

But one rule I've always felt needed to be established was if it's his family that there's an issue with he deals with them. 
If it's my family then I'll deal with them.  
(This is just a respect thing for me I don't feel it's right for me to go yelling at his mom. It's just not what I've ever been comfortable with.) 

He's never minded this and any time it's had to do with something shady towards our kids he is on top of things confronting his mom without hesitation and I completely adore him for it.  He makes me feel very secure. 

Okay now with the back story part done here we are April 7th. My daughter (Matty 13f) is staying the weekend at SIL (Bumper 37f) and niece (Gemmy 16f). 

Bumpers having her bathroom renovated so SIL , Gemmy and Matty go to MIL (victim 64f) apt to shower.  I'm at home getting ready for work and my phone is buzzing none stop. I will post the screen shot of the texts that Matty and Gemmy were sending me.

But they were saying that BIL (Mim 35m) who lives with victim has been yelling at her all day long,  over her not being able to track his package for him.  

This is a problem for two reasons.  1 victim has our youngest son Lulu (5m) and has previously been kept from seeing him because of how she let's Mim act around him.  (It gives our boy the idea that talking this way to grandma is okay and accepted.  That these behaviors are okay , and then it's really hard to get him back on track once we bring him home.)

He hadn't been there for 4 months up until this point and was only staying over night because Sessy and I had to work night shift. 

 And 2nd problem was Matty isn't suppose to be at victims house at all anymore without her dad or I present.  Simply because of how victim treats her when Matty tells us what's happening over there. 

So the girls are texting that Mim has been yelling and cussing most of the entire time they've been there and lulu is holding onto Matty and looks really scared from all the yelling.  

I immediately wake up Sessy and tell him as soon as he drops me at work he needs to go get lulu.  He asked why and I read him the girls texts.  

He grabs his phone and starts texting like crazy and from experience I already know he's texting his mom and it's probably not good.  

Gemmy texts right after Sessy texts MIL and says ""please don't tell meemaw we told you because she'll yell at us"" and that struck a nerve in me.  But I told them if she yells at them to let me know immediately!! 

FAST FORWARD 

A hour later I just got to work and went in to stock cooler like usual and 15 minutes into my shift my phone starts ringing its a unknown number (turns out Bumper had just gotten a new phone and different number and hasn't had the chance to let us know yet).

When I answer its Matty , balling her eyes out trying to get the words out but she's crying so hard she can't breathe. (She is sensitive but in moments like these I know something is truly wrong,  not just a reaction of a sensitive girl. ) 

I'm telling her to relax , take a deep breath its okay I'm here and once she's calm she can tell me what's wrong.  

Finally she exhales and says ""meemaw is mad at me and said it's all my fault lulu isn't allowed over there anymore.  She told lulu he wouldn't be coming over anymore and when he asked why she told him go ask your sister it's her fault for making up lies. Meemaw was throwing dishes in the sink breaking them and then she looked at Gemmy and said you and your mom are welcome here anytime but that's it.  Don't bring company to my house anymore.  Gemmy your mom is on her way so you guys need to go wait outside for her. ""  my niece then speaks ""yeah and it took mom like 45 minutes to even get there."" (The call is on speaker phone) Bumper comes into the conversation ""I'm so sorry sis I had no idea mom would act like that I will never take Matty over there ever again that was so wrong for her to act like that towards her. "" 

I tell my daughter I love her and it's not her fault , she was doing exactly what her dad and I have always told her to do. That I was going to take care of it asap. 

I will attach the message I sent to victim and what her reply was. 

I feel like I might have been the AH because I could've just let my husband deal with her but I reacted in a moment of anger and disgust.  Simply for the fact of her feeling how she reacted was appropriate. My daughter is only her step grand child so it made me feel that's why she feels it's okay to tell Matty she's no longer welcome in her home. 

Husband and SIL agree with what I sent her but SIL's boyfriend says I'm wrong and it wasn't my place to speak to victim like that at all... one thing to mention is SIL's bf and MIL work together and have for a few years they're closer than any of us are to MIL including her own kids!! 

SIL went through a really bad work accident a couple of years ago and for people that knew her before it happened know that she's still not herself and maybe never will be. But hey bf and victim make fun of her for her memory issues and her ocd rituals she's had after the accident.

I'm looking at a 2017 Honda Civic 1.5t tomorrow but thought I'd check parts availability. Not sure if I'm looking in the wrong places but I can't seem to find common parts for this car. Are they dealer only, or do they generally not need regular replacements so motor factors don't stock them?

Looking at things like:

shock absorber
coil spring
linkages
top mount bearings
ABS sensor

I've looked at GSF and Euro car parts. And none in stock at either. The two Fords I've had recently seemed to eat through these items hence looking now. It's been years since I had Honda (8th gen civic 2.2 and Del Sol) so a little out of touch.


Any advice on parts availability, general costs, and also likelihood/frequency of replacements - my ford was an annual ritual eating through top mount bearings and shocks!!

I believe this is by design as the gov needs us to eat the costs of inflation and gold has historically kept up with inflation. For example, it took a similar amount of gold to buy a home in 1925 as it does today. With bonds, you end up loosing money as the coupon rate rarely exceeds the actual/real inflation rate and as a result you are being robbed. The only solace, is that you can avoid even greater losses by choosing bonds over stocks. Thoughts or am I crazy? My current ideal portfolio would be 40% gold ETF, 40% I fund, and 20% C fund.

1k67cj6,repweidiansneakers,"[MOD POST] Finding, Writing, and Sharing High-Quality Reviews","Hi all,

This post will become the latest automoderator post in the group, [r/RepWeidianSneakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepWeidianSneakers/). It will aim to help community members either identify high-quality reviews to use when forming their opinions OR write their own high-quality reviews to give back to the community. This post will outline the key components of a high-quality review, and community members can easily reference this post when navigating the rep world, as certain communities can be littered with paid promotional ads from ""reviewers,"" which can lead to [newer members being led astray](https://imgur.com/a/yVco7FM).

This group was built upon the philosophy of doing your own research in order to form educated opinions. Thinking back to middle school, finding reputable sources is key in this process. Let's go over how to spot reliable content and how to produce reliable content yourself.

# Bare Minimum:

1. **Include Anything Needed to Remake the Purchase from Scratch:**

Imagine you are brand new to the rep world. What information would you need in order to remake the purchase you are reviewing?

a. Seller Name and Contact Information (W2C Link, WeChat, or WhatsApp)

b. Batch Name

c. Silhouette Name

d. Price Paid

e. Payment Method Used

2. **In-Hand Pictures**

You purchased the product and have it in your hands. Take some pictures! Reviews are not the time to use QC pictures, stock pictures, or no pictures at all. In my experience, reviews without pictures are often seller-alt accounts or buyers posting only because the seller asked them to.

And look, I get it. Not everyone has the time to write detailed posts for every single post. When he's not giving us solid batch vs batch comparisons, group member [Chyllian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chyllian/) gives us some crisp in-hand pictures with most of the relevant information listed above, like he does here in[ his in-hand post of GX Batch AJ4 F&F Mochas](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1eqi1ch/inhand_aj4_travis_scott_ff_mocha_450260_direct/).

# Key Components of a High-Quality Review:

1. **What Led You to Purchase This Batch In Particular? How Does Your Purchase Compare to Other Batches On The Market?**

Remember, mentioning the batch name is in the Bare Minimum section, so we've already lost the majority of reviews from the paid ""reviewers."" This is of course not counting when they do list a batch name and it either is a non-existent batch or is not actually what they received.

Here is your chance to take people through your thought process. Don't simply say ""message this seller and use my discount code: SoldMySoulForShoes"" - walk the readers through it. ""I purchased Y Batch because of its overall accuracy and price point/advantages over Z Batch including XYZ/it was on sale even though it is not a top batch."" Or, you can simply compare and contrast pros and cons of your purchase versus other batches on the market.

*Example:* Check out group member [content\_baby\_6763](https://www.reddit.com/user/content_baby_6763/)'s review on [DGC AJ3 AMMs here](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1evkymi/in_handon_foot_jordan_3_a_ma_mani%C3%A9re_violet_ore/). They go over the current options on the market and why they made the selection that they did. Add in the well-formatted title and detailed logistical review, and it's a great review.

2. **Title Contains Key Terms to Make the Post Searchable**

What good is your review if nobody can find it? Make sure your title contains the relevant details that someone using the search bar would need to use to find your post. In order of importance, this includes Batch Name, Silhouette, Price, and Seller Name. An example of a strong title would be \[REVIEW\] $92 LJR Batch TS1 Fragments from TMF.

*Example:* [This review](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1e8fscw/review_130_tg_batch_onitsuka_tiger_tokuten_from/) from group member [Shatterrrrrr](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shatterrrrrr/) does this excellently, outlines his overall purchasing process, and even touches on flaws on his purchase. Even as a first time post, this review blows many others out of the water.

# Cherries on Top

1. Formatting!

How you format a review can go a long way. Don't just write a block of text as that can be difficult to follow. Reddit offers different formatting options like **bold**, *italics*, headings, titles. Use these to your advantage.

*Example:* Check out rep veteran [Rep-Hippie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rep-Hippie/)'s [on-foot review](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1ehj8bd/rfa_white_thunder_on_foot_review/), where he uses headings to separate his review into different sections, making it easy for the reader to either follow completely or quickly find specific sections.

2. Linking Relevant Posts or Resources

This is a personal favorite of mine. Rather than simply stating an opinion, let people see it with their own eyes. Linking batch comparison posts, replica vs retail posts, stock images, or even other reviews in your post can help show others you've done your research. It also expedites the research process for any readers. Again, Rep-Hippie's review linked above does this excellently.

3. Going Above and Beyond With Details

This is going to be the hardest point to hit unless you really, really put in the work in terms of knowing the product you purchased. The reviews that I personally weigh most are those that hit all of the points above *and* display a great depth of knowledge. rep veteran [previous\_muffin\_6199](https://www.reddit.com/user/previous_muffin_6199/) constantly puts on masterclasses of this, but I'll like just one example [here of his review on Updated LJR AJ4 Military Blues](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1enyg6s/updated_ljr_ln4_reviewrep_vs_retail_reveal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). In a singular post, you get a replica vs retail comparison, a batch vs batch comparison, tips on how to legit check (from batch characteristics to size tag details), to tips on how to make sure you aren't unintentionally or intentionally bait and switched. In my opinion, this is where everyone should try to get, but it takes time, effort, and practice.

# Key Components NOT Included

Let me be clear - receiving a pair discounted or at no cost does not disqualify anyone from writing a helpful, truthful review. Sure, readers should be more wary when they see a review for a product that was in some way subsidized. *However*, it takes effort and some knowledge to *actually* write a review, and not just be a seller-servant advertising account. [Without effort, you end up advertising upmarked budget batches, or becoming the people lying in the comments under each other's posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakerreps/comments/1bjp0mu/comment/kvtkh57/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Utilizing the components listed above, you should be able to distinguish between anyone who is ""reviewing"" simply for the sake of receiving free pairs of shoes, and those who are reviewing in order to help the community. Don't forget that *anyone* can become a ""reviewer,"" and it's ultimately up to you to decide what kind of reviewer you'd like to be. As Uncle Ben once said...

1k6718m,BetaReaders,[Complete] [60k] [YA / Upmarket] Just About Coping,"Hello!  
I’m looking for feedback on the first few chapters of my novel, *Just About Coping*. The protagonist is young, but this is *not* completely a YA book—it’s gritty, raw, and emotionally heavy. Think *Shameless* meets *Lullabies for Little Criminals*.

There’s no sexual content, but the book does contain mature themes that may be difficult for some readers, including parental neglect, substance abuse, emotional trauma, and involvement with the legal system.

Would love to swap!

Eighteen-year-old Nathan Walker is holding it together. Barely.

He’s got it down to a science: keep the fridge stocked, the lights on, the kids fed, and his head down. With his mom slipping further out of reach and his dad long gone, Nathan’s the only thing standing between his younger siblings and the kind of chaos you don’t come back from.

But survival isn’t the same as living.

College is supposed to be his escape—a chance to finally breathe. He just has to get through the summer without everything falling apart. But as pressure builds, cracks form—at home, at school, and deep inside Nathan himself. The weight of responsibility is starting to grind him down, and holding the world together might cost him the last pieces of himself he’s been trying to protect.

How Does FBA Amazon Work: A Step-by-Step Guide for New Sellers
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding the Basics of Amazon FBA

Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a service that lets sellers store products in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Amazon takes care of picking, packing, shipping, and providing customer service. This setup allows you to focus on sourcing and marketing your products while Amazon handles logistics.

When you use FBA, your items are eligible for Amazon Prime, offering fast, free shipping to millions of customers. This can boost your sales and increase buyer trust since shoppers know their orders will be handled by Amazon’s reliable system.

### Setting Up Your Seller Account and Creating Product Listings

To start selling with FBA, you need a professional seller account on Amazon. This involves registering on Amazon Seller Central and providing necessary details about your business. Once your account is active, you can create product listings for the items you’d like to sell.

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
Listing products requires entering key information such as product title, description, images, and pricing. You should optimize your product listings with relevant keywords to help potential buyers find your items more easily. Keep titles clear and concise, descriptions informative yet simple, and images high-quality.

### Preparing and Shipping Your Inventory to Amazon’s Warehouses

After your product listings are live, the next step is sending your inventory to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Amazon provides step-by-step guidance within Seller Central on how to prepare, label, and ship your products correctly.

Here’s a breakdown of the shipment preparation process:

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
- **Label your products:** Use Amazon’s barcode labels unless your products already come with manufacturer barcodes.
- **Package items safely:** Make sure items are packed securely to prevent damage during transit and storage.
- **Create a shipping plan:** Specify the quantity and choose the shipping method. Amazon often splits shipments to multiple warehouses for faster delivery.
- **Ship your inventory:** Use carriers Amazon recommends or your preferred freight service.

Once Amazon receives your stock, they scan and store it in their inventory system.

### How Customer Orders Are Fulfilled

When a customer buys your product, Amazon picks the item from its warehouse, packs it efficiently, and ships it directly to the buyer. This automation is a huge advantage as it simplifies order fulfillment and speeds up delivery times.

Amazon also manages customer service and handles returns for FBA orders. This means you won’t have to worry about customer inquiries or refunds, as Amazon’s dedicated team manages those interactions.

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
### Tracking Inventory and Managing Sales Performance

Using Amazon Seller Central, you can track your inventory levels, monitor sales performance, and analyze customer feedback. It’s important to keep an eye on your stock so you can send more inventory before running out. Running out of stock can hurt your product rank and sales momentum.

Seller Central offers valuable reports and sales data that help you make informed decisions about pricing, promotion, and inventory reordering.

### Benefits of Using FBA for New Sellers

- **Access to Prime customers:** FBA products qualify for Amazon Prime’s fast, free shipping, attracting more buyers.
- **Hands-free fulfillment:** Amazon handles packing, shipping, and customer service, freeing up your time.
- **Multi-channel fulfillment:** You can use FBA to fulfill orders from other sales channels such as your website or eBay.
- **Amazon’s trusted reputation:** Buyers are more likely to purchase when they know Amazon is handling fulfillment.
- **Improved shipping reliability:** FBA offers efficient and reliable shipping options worldwide.

### Costs Involved with Using Amazon FBA

It’s important to understand the fees involved before starting with FBA. Amazon charges for storage space your products take up and for fulfillment when an order ships. The main fees include:

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
- **Storage fees:** Charged monthly based on the volume (cubic feet) your inventory occupies in the warehouse.
- **Fulfillment fees:** Charged per unit shipped, covering picking, packing, shipping, and customer service.
- **Additional fees:** For optional services like labeling or removal of inventory.

Be sure to factor these costs into your pricing strategy to maintain healthy profit margins.

### Tips for Success When Using FBA

- Start with products that sell well and have a good profit margin, considering FBA fees.
- Use keyword research tools to optimize your product listings for Amazon’s search engine.
- Keep your inventory levels steady to avoid stockouts that affect your seller rankings.
- Monitor customer reviews and respond promptly if you notice recurring issues.
- Take advantage of Amazon’s promotional tools like coupons and ads to increase visibility.

### Final Thoughts on Leveraging Amazon’s FBA Program

By using FBA, you gain access to Amazon’s robust logistics network, saving time on shipping and customer support. Learning how FBA works helps you plan inventory and drive sales more effectively. Whether you’re launching a new product or scaling your online business, FBA’s convenience and reach can be a game-changer for your success on Amazon. Take the time to understand each step of the process, and you’ll be better equipped to provide great service and grow your selling business.

Key Benefits and Challenges of Using Amazon FBA for E-Commerce Success
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exploring the Advantages of Using Amazon FBA for Your Online Store

Amazon FBA, short for Fulfillment by Amazon, has emerged as a popular choice among e-commerce sellers looking to boost their business. It offers a streamlined way to handle storage, packaging, and shipping, letting you focus more on growing your brand and less on logistics. One of the biggest benefits you’ll notice with Amazon FBA is the vast network of fulfillment centers. These centers enable faster delivery times for customers, often with free or low-cost shipping options like Amazon Prime, which can drastically improve your product visibility and sales potential.

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
Another key benefit is the hassle-free customer service and returns management. When you use FBA, Amazon takes care of customer inquiries, refunds, and returns, which can relieve a huge burden from your shoulders. This reliable system builds trust with buyers since they know any issues will be handled promptly and professionally.

Amazon’s trusted reputation is also a driving force behind many sellers’ success on the platform. By leveraging the FBA service, your products become eligible for Prime shipping and are often featured higher in search results. This exposure can increase buyer confidence, making them more likely to choose your listings over competitors who don’t offer FBA.

Inventory management also becomes easier with Amazon FBA. The platform integrates tools that provide insights into stock levels, sales data, and shipment status. You get detailed reports to help you make smarter decisions about restocking or removing items. This reduces the risk of overstocking or running out of popular products, which can negatively impact your business.

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
### Understanding the Common Challenges Sellers Face with Amazon FBA

While Amazon FBA opens doors to remarkable opportunities, it’s important to understand the challenges involved. The biggest concern for many sellers is the cost structure. FBA fees include storage charges, fulfillment fees, and sometimes unexpected costs like long-term storage fees or removal fees. These expenses can add up and eat into your profit margins, especially if your products have slow sales or are bulky.

Managing inventory upload and shipment planning can also feel complex at first. You need to comply with Amazon's packaging, labeling, and shipping requirements to avoid delays or extra fees. For new sellers, wrapping their head around these operational details can be time-consuming and sometimes overwhelming.

Another challenge is the increased competition within the Amazon marketplace itself. When you use FBA, you’re competing against countless other sellers, many of whom use the same fulfillment system. This competition drives down prices and forces sellers to continually optimize product listings, marketing strategies, and customer engagement to maintain a competitive edge.

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
Because Amazon controls the fulfillment process, you also lose some control over your brand experience. Packaging and delivery generally follow Amazon's standard, so customization options are limited. For shoppers who value a personalized experience, this may influence their perception of your brand.

### How to Maximize Benefits While Overcoming Amazon FBA Challenges

If you decide to leverage Amazon FBA, focusing on product selection and pricing strategy is crucial. Start by choosing products with high demand but low competition, and make sure your prices factor in all FBA costs to maintain healthy profit margins.

To keep costs manageable, regularly monitor your inventory levels and sales performance. Avoid letting slow-moving products accumulate in Amazon’s warehouses, where long-term storage fees can quickly erode profits. Scheduling periodic inventory audits and using Amazon’s inventory management tools can make this easier.

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
Clear and accurate product listings also play a vital role in standing out. Use high-quality images and well-written descriptions incorporating relevant keywords to make sure your products appear in search results. The better your listing performs, the higher your chances of benefiting from Amazon’s vast customer base.

Engaging with customer feedback and reviews helps strengthen your seller reputation. Positive reviews boost buyer confidence and increase the likelihood of repeat purchases, while promptly addressing negative feedback can help resolve issues and improve your ratings.

By understanding both the benefits and challenges of Amazon FBA, you can make informed decisions to enhance your e-commerce business. With careful planning and active management, FBA offers a powerful platform to scale your operations, reach more customers, and achieve success in the competitive world of online retail.

### Conclusion

Understanding how FBA Amazon works opens up a world of opportunities for new sellers eager to enter the e-commerce market. By following the step-by-step guide, you can confidently navigate the process—from setting up your seller account to sending products to Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Leveraging Amazon’s extensive logistics network allows you to focus more on growing your brand while Amazon handles storage, shipping, and customer service.

[Learn to Build a Six-Figure Amazon FBA Business! Complete Blueprint! 14-Day Money-Back GUARANTEE!!](https://infointeract.com/six-figure-amazon-fba)  
  
The benefits of using Amazon FBA are considerable. You gain access to fast shipping options, which improve customer experience and boost your chances of winning the Buy Box. FBA also helps scale your business without the headache of managing inventory and fulfillment on your own. However, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges, like storage fees and the need to monitor inventory levels closely. These factors require careful planning to maintain profitability.

Ultimately, Amazon FBA can be a powerful tool for e-commerce success when you understand both its advantages and limitations. By using the system wisely, you can streamline operations and reach a larger audience with less effort. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to grow, mastering how FBA Amazon works can set the foundation for a thriving online business.",fba amazon work,learn build sixfigure amazon fba business

1k66fki,EverHint,"[News and Sentiment in a Nutshell - Tariffs Radar] April 23, 2025, Mid-Day","# Tariffs Radar: Midday Analysis on Trump Administration Tariffs - April 23, 2025

Hey r/EverHint folks, welcome to today’s Tariffs Radar! It’s April 23, 2025, and as of midday (11:20 AM PDT), we’re diving into how the Trump administration tariffs—effective since April 2, 2025—are shaking up the U.S. and global economies. Using the latest news from the past 12 hours and today’s market data, we’ll break down significant events, gauge sentiment across economic sectors, and spotlight the tariffs’ effects. Let’s get started!

## Market Snapshot
Today’s market data shows the national 30-year fixed mortgage rate dipping to 7.00%, down 5 basis points from 7.05%. The 15-year rate also eased to 6.16%, while the 5-year ARM ticked up to 7.79%. These shifts suggest a mixed response in housing finance—possibly a reaction to tariff-related economic uncertainty softening demand, though it’s early to pin it all on that.

## Key Themes from the News

### 1. U.S.-China Trade Negotiations: Signs of De-escalation?
A big story today is the buzz around U.S.-China trade talks. Here’s what’s popping up:

- **Treasury Secretary Speaks Out**: Scott Bessent hinted that the U.S. might lower tariffs on China to kickstart trade talks, calling current levels “not sustainable” (*Business and Economic News*, 1 hour ago). The White House is reportedly mulling this move too (*Breaking News*, 4 hours ago).
- **China’s Response**: President Xi warned against U.S. coercion but signaled openness to dialogue (*Breaking News*, 7 hours ago). China’s also backing Iran’s nuclear talks with the U.S., adding a geopolitical twist (*Business and Economic News*, 2 hours ago).
- **Market Reaction**: Wall Street’s loving it—stocks rallied, with the Nasdaq up 4% on tariff relief hopes (*Breaking News*, 3 hours ago). European shares hit a three-week high too (*Business and Economic News*, 1 hour ago).

This could mean a thaw in tensions, which has markets cautiously optimistic. But Bessent tempered expectations, saying no unilateral tariff cuts are on the table yet (*Breaking News*, 2 hours ago).

### 2. Sector-Specific Impacts in the U.S.
The tariffs are hitting U.S. sectors differently. Let’s break it down:

#### Technology
- **Earnings Clues**: Tesla’s shares rose despite a weak Q1, with Musk refocusing on affordable EVs and Robotaxi (*Earnings Reports*, 9 hours ago). Apple’s stock climbed 3.2% on tariff reduction hopes (*Stock Market News*, 5 hours ago).
- **Analyst Moves**: Morgan Stanley started Duolingo at Overweight, signaling tech growth potential (*Stock Market News*, 2 hours ago).
- **Sentiment**: **Cautiously Optimistic**. Supply chain fears linger, but easing tariffs could boost tech giants.

#### Manufacturing
- **Mixed Signals**: U.S. Manufacturing PMI beat expectations, showing expansion (*Economic Indicators*, 4 hours ago). But firms like Avery Dennison missed Q1 estimates, citing tariff costs (*Earnings Reports*, 6 hours ago).
- **Boeing’s Take**: CEO noted potential redirection of planes from China due to tariffs (*Stock Market News*, 4 hours ago).
- **Sentiment**: **Mixed**. Some resilience, but tariff pressures are real.

#### Automotive
- **Earnings Insight**: General Motors got a Buy rating from Citi at $62 (*Stock Analyst Rating*, 4 hours ago), while Tesla’s pushing cheaper models (*Earnings Reports*, 9 hours ago).
- **Global Moves**: BYD’s revamping Europe ops to dodge tariffs (*Stock Market News*, 8 hours ago).
- **Sentiment**: **Cautiously Optimistic**. Innovation’s helping, but tariffs complicate supply chains.

#### Energy
- **Oil Fluctuations**: Prices dipped despite a smaller-than-expected U.S. crude inventory rise (*Economic Indicators*, 3 hours ago). NextEra Energy beat estimates, focusing on renewables (*Earnings Reports*, 6 hours ago).
- **Analyst Downgrades**: Barclays cut Chevron to Sell (*Stock Market News*, 3 hours ago).
- **Sentiment**: **Neutral**. Renewables shine, but oil’s jittery.

#### Financials
- **Earnings Variability**: Stifel missed Q1 estimates (*Earnings Reports*, 5 hours ago), while East-West Bancorp surged 10% on strong results (*Stock Market News*, 2 hours ago).
- **Sentiment**: **Cautiously Negative**. Tariff uncertainty’s weighing on banks.

#### Healthcare
- **Solid Performers**: Boston Scientific beat Q1 forecasts (*Earnings Reports*, 7 hours ago), but tariff impacts on devices linger.
- **Sentiment**: **Neutral to Positive**. Resilience holds, with minor supply chain hiccups.

#### Consumer Goods
- **Mixed Bag**: Philip Morris lifted its outlook on ZYN demand (*Earnings Reports*, 6 hours ago), but Reckitt dropped 4% on weak U.S. sales (*Earnings Reports*, 9 hours ago).
- **Sentiment**: **Mixed**. Some winners, but tariff costs hurt others.

### 3. International Ripples
The tariffs aren’t just a U.S. story—here’s the global angle:

- **Europe**: EU’s pushing for a negotiated U.S. deal but prepping countermeasures (*Business and Economic News*, 1 hour ago). Volvo cut its North America outlook amid tariff uncertainty (*Stock Market News*, 8 hours ago).
- **Asia**: Vietnam’s talking trade with the U.S. to dodge 46% tariffs (*Economic Indicators*, 4 hours ago). China’s BYD and XPeng are adapting overseas (*Stock Market News*, 9 hours ago).
- **India**: World Bank cut its growth forecast, citing tariff fallout (*Business and Economic News*, 7 hours ago).
- **Global Sentiment**: **Cautiously Optimistic**. Hope for talks balances current strains.

## Tariffs’ Sectoral Effects
The tariffs are flexing their muscle across sectors:
- **Tech & Auto**: Supply chain disruptions are a headache, but potential relief could ease costs.
- **Manufacturing**: Higher input costs are squeezing margins, though some firms adapt.
- **Consumer Goods**: Price hikes loom, but demand varies by product.
- **Energy**: Oil’s volatile, renewables less hit.

## Wrapping Up
As of midday, the Trump tariffs are a mixed bag. Trade talks with China hint at relief, lifting markets and softening some sector pain. Tech and auto show promise, manufacturing and finance feel the pinch, and global players are adjusting. Keep an eye on these negotiations—they could shift the vibe big time. Stay tuned, and let’s see where this ride takes us!

1k65u15,sidehustlemoney,Here's a travel tip on how to get nearly free business and economy flights,"You may have heard of travel hacking or award hacking, and it’s always sounded stupid or over-complicated. But I’m about to share how easy it actually can be, and the secrets of how some people basically travel for free.

Let me share with you a few examples before I start.

* I booked a roundtrip flight to Vancouver for $14 that would have costed me $400. That’s 97% OFF!!
* I booked a roundtrip ticket to Italy on BUSINESS CLASS for $56 that originally costed $3000! We don’t even have to do the math on this one..
* I booked a Hilton hotel for $36 that would have costed $700.

**\*\*What you need\*\***

I’ll break it down with you how this is possible.

You’ll only need two things. One of them is an AMEX Gold card. I know a lot of people might not like the idea of having another credit card, especially one that has a $250 annual fee! But DO NOT BE SCARED. Let me explain why and you’ll understand.

Firstly, the card offers you $120 off a year on Ubereats, and another $120 off a year on other dining options like Grubhub, Shake Shack, etc. You immediately get back $240 of the $250. You basically pay $10, to be able to book flights and hotels basically for free. Trust me, as someone who likes to save money, it’s extremely worth it.

The second thing you need is Rakuten. Rakuten is a reputable website with millions of users that gives you up to 10–20% cash back on popular stores like Nike, Petsmart, Target, etc. It also gives you cash back on a ton of local dining options. You can choose to redeem your cash back either with a check, Paypal, or AMEX membership points.

**\*\*Now to the fun stuff.\*\***

The other day, I needed to buy some new shoes(I do this about once a year), and some pet food for my dog. Rakuten had a deal for 20% cash back on Petsmart, and 20% cash back on Nike. Amex Gold was also offering a deal for an additional 5% cash back from both of these stores. (Amex will give out offers every week for popular stores you shop at, that you can combine with Rakuten).

I spent about $700 total and Petsmart and Nike. About $500 on pet supplies, which I stocked a for few months, and $200 on shoes, socks, and a t-shirt.

With 25% cash back, you get 25 AMEX points. With $700, you get 17500 AMEX points.

AMEX allows you to transfer your points to many airlines and hotels. Air Canada often times has great deals for flights booked with points. I had already planned to go to Vancouver and found a great flight for 17000 AMEX points. The original cost of the ticket would have been $400.

If I had normal cash back card that gave me 2% cash back. I would have gotten 2% of $700, which is $14. THAT $14 WAS USED TO BUY A $400 PLANE TICKET!!!

**\*\*Final words\*\***

This was just one example of many that can be used to get deals like this. Rakuten and Amex both give out new offers every week that are very easy to use, and are at stores that you normally would go to. AMEX Gold also offers 4X points for Dining and Groceries, which you also can sometimes stack with Rakuten dining deals.

Air Canada is just one of the airlines that AMEX allows you to transfer to. If you want to go to Europe, Air France has a lot of great deals. If you want to go to Asia, Singapore Airlines has a lot of great deals. If you want to book a hotel, Hilton has a lot of great deals. There are many more examples that I can give.

Some transfer partners often aren’t as good of a deal as others, like Delta for example.

I’ve been travel hacking for a few years now, and let me just say. It’s really nice being able to travel without worrying about how much the trip will cost!

**\*\*Additional Tips\*\***

You can also substitute the Amex Gold with the Capital One Venture X. AMEX Gold gives you 4X points for dining and groceries, but 1X points of other categories. Venture X gives you 2X points on all purchases, which can be used to get more points on retail, cell phone bill, and other purchases.

1k60nkb,ChartNavigators,Sector Spotlight,"The market is showing broad-based strength this week, with every major S&P 500 sector in the green. Let’s break down the top performers, highlight key trends, and spark discussion on what’s driving these moves and where investors might look next.
https://flic.kr/p/2qZoH4T



Financials (XLF) +3.31%  
Financials are leading the rally, climbing over 3% this week. Some of the top stocks driving this sector are likely major banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Consider potential catalysts like interest rate hikes and earnings reports.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +3.16%  
This sector is also outperforming, possibly thanks to strong retail sales data and upbeat guidance from leading consumer brands. Top stocks moving this sector include Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Home Depot (HD). Growth in travel, leisure, and luxury goods could be fueling the gains.

Utilities (XLU) +2.73%  
Utilities, typically considered a defensive play, are showing surprising strength. Key players in this sector include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK), and Southern Company (SO). This could signal a flight to safety amid broader market uncertainty.

Communication Services (XLC) +2.61%  
Big tech and media names are pushing this sector higher. Top stocks in this sector include Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Verizon (VZ). Look for catalysts like strong ad revenues and streaming growth.

Energy (XLE) +2.55%  
Energy stocks continue to benefit from firm oil prices and robust demand. Major companies influencing this sector include ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP). The sector’s gains may be tied to geopolitical developments or supply constraints.

Technology (XLK) +2.44%  
Tech is keeping pace with the broader market. Top stocks in tech include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). AI momentum, chip demand, and cloud growth remain key drivers.

Materials (XLB) +2.34%  
Materials are up, possibly on the back of commodity price strength and global infrastructure spending. Key stocks include Linde (LIN), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX). Chemical producers and miners could be leading the charge.

Real Estate (XLRE) +2.04%  
Real estate is rebounding, perhaps as investors hunt for value or respond to stabilizing interest rates. Top REITs in this sector include Prologis (PLD), American Tower (AMT), and Simon Property Group (SPG). REITs in logistics, data centers, and residential sectors may be worth watching.

Health Care (XLV) +1.88%  
Health care is positive but lagging the leaders. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Pfizer (PFE) are key stocks. This could reflect mixed earnings or shifting sentiment around drug pricing and regulation.

Industrials (XLI) +1.75%  
Industrials are gaining, potentially on strong manufacturing data or infrastructure tailwinds. Major players include United Parcel Service (UPS), Caterpillar (CAT), and Boeing (BA). Aerospace, defense, and transportation stocks might be driving the sector.

Consumer Staples (XLP) +1.42%  
Staples are up, but underperforming the rest of the market. Top consumer staple stocks include Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO), and Walmart (WMT). Investors may be rotating out of defensive names as risk appetite increases.

1k4npx3,thestallionvibe,"Navigating the $TSLA, $NVDA, and $AMZN Rollercoaster: Market Trends and Strategies","The financial markets are currently navigating a complex landscape, influenced by political rhetoric, economic policy concerns, and a broad sense of unease. This post aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current market trends, potential trading and investing signals, and actionable strategies to navigate these challenging conditions.

Market Trends and Stock Index Performance

Index Performance

The S&P 500 has seen significant volatility, with a notable drop in recent sessions, indicating bearish sentiment driven by political uncertainties and economic policy concerns. The 52-week range is 4835.04 - 6147.43, with a market day high of 5232.94 and a previous close of 5282.7.

The NASDAQ Composite has experienced a decline, reflecting broader market concerns. The tech-heavy index's performance is often a bellwether for investor sentiment in growth stocks. The 52-week range is 14784.03 - 20204.58, with a market day high of 16066.792 and a previous close of 16286.447.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has seen a sharp decline, with over 900 points lost in a single session, likely due to renewed investor worries stemming from political rhetoric and economic policy uncertainties. The 52-week range is 36611.78 - 45073.63, with a market day high of 38906.04 and a previous close of 39142.23.

Commodities and Currencies

Gold prices have been on the rise, indicating a flight to safety as investors seek refuge from market volatility. The 52-week range is 2277.6 - 3442.3, with a market day high of 3442.3 and a previous close of 3328.4.

Oil has shown some stability, but the broader market sentiment could impact future price movements. Geopolitical tensions and supply-demand dynamics will be key factors to watch. The 52-week range is 55.12 - 84.52, with a market day high of 64.42 and a previous close of 64.68.

The US Dollar has been relatively stable, but any significant shifts in monetary policy or geopolitical events could lead to volatility. The 52-week range is 97.921 - 110.18, with a market day high of 99.208 and a previous close of 99.376.

Bitcoin has seen significant volatility, reflecting its sensitivity to broader market sentiment and regulatory developments. The 52-week range is 49121.24 - 109114.88, with a market day high of 88404.57 and a previous close of 85169.61.

Overall Market Sentiment

There appears to be a general sense of unease in the market, with concerns about rising political and economic uncertainty contributing to a broad selloff in risk assets. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China are weighing on investor sentiment across various sectors. Speculations regarding who will succeed Fed Chair Powell add another layer of uncertainty.

Potential Trading and Investing Signals

Risk Aversion: The rise in gold prices and the decline in major indices suggest a shift towards risk aversion. Investors may want to consider defensive sectors or assets that typically perform well during market downturns.

Volatility: The sharp declines in major indices indicate increased market volatility. Traders might look for opportunities in options trading or other strategies that can benefit from heightened volatility.

Economic Policy Uncertainty: Political rhetoric and economic policy concerns are driving market sentiment. Investors should stay informed about any developments in this area, as they could lead to further market movements.

Sector Rotation: With growth stocks under pressure, there may be opportunities in value stocks or sectors that are less sensitive to interest rate changes and economic policy shifts.

Diversification: Given the current market conditions, diversification across asset classes and sectors could help mitigate risk. Investors might consider adding exposure to commodities, bonds, or other alternative investments.

Safe-Haven Assets: The rise in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) could indicate a flight to safety, with investors seeking to reduce risk.

Options Activity: Unusual options activity in stocks like Lululemon Athletica (LULU), and Workday (WDAY) might signal potential shifts in investor sentiment.

Short Interest: Changes in short interest for stocks like Elanco Animal Health (ELAN), Carvana (CVNA), and LTC Properties (LTC) could provide insights into market expectations.

Tariff Sensitivity: Companies with significant exposure to tariffs, particularly those reliant on Chinese imports or exports, may experience increased volatility.

Banking Consolidation: The Capital One-Discover merger could pave the way for more deals in the sector.

Fintech Disruption: Circle’s new payments network and CSI’s AI-driven AML solution highlight innovation in fintech.

Income Opportunities: Bond ETFs like Invesco BulletShares remain attractive for income-focused investors.

Regulatory Risks: Increased SEC and FTC actions could impact corporate practices and compliance costs.

AI Growth: Continued advancements in AI present opportunities but also regulatory challenges for tech giants.

Stocks and Sectors to Watch

Technology: Keep an eye on Alphabet (Google), Apple, and Meta. Alphabet appears to be viewed as more resilient in an uncertain macro environment. Watch for potential impact from investigations into Meta.

Retail: Walmart and Target are in focus due to discussions with the government regarding tariffs.

Consumer Goods: Monitor PepsiCo (PEP) due to political and tariff risks.

Financials: Financial stocks like American Express (AXP), Blackstone (BX), and Ally Financial (ALLY) experienced declines.

EV: Watch Tesla (TSLA) for production delays and Rivian (RIVN) for policy uncertainty.

Rare Earth Materials: Monitor MP Materials (MP) amid rising trade tensions.

Real Estate: LTC Properties (LTC) has seen an increase in short interest, suggesting a potentially bearish outlook from some investors.

Restaurants: Tariff pressures could reshape restaurant buildout economics, impacting companies like Wingstop (WING), Sweetgreen (SG), and Cava Group (CAVA).

Ford Motor Company (F): Watch for a potential yield trap.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A promising stock to add to watch, as its earnings have been strong and the company has a history of innovation and growth.

High Growth Momentum Stocks

Copart, Inc. (CPRT): Significant market cap. High P/E ratio suggests a premium valuation. Watch for continued growth to justify the current price.

Lantheus Holdings Inc (LNTH): Relatively lower P/E ratio compared to Copart.

Stride Inc (LRN): Relatively lower P/E ratio compared to Copart.

Bearish Sentiment and Potential Risks

TSLA (Tesla): Concerns about the company's future, including potential bankruptcy and the impact of a new CEO, are prevalent.

NVDA (Nvidia): There is a belief that the AI bubble is starting to pop, which could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.

AMZN (Amazon) & MSFT (Microsoft): Economic concerns are reflected in paused data center lease commitments and slowed build-outs.

WMT (Walmart), HD (Home Depot), LOW (Lowe's), TGT (Target): These retailers are expected to face substantial hits to their profit margins due to tariffs.

Several articles mention investigations by Pomerantz Law Firm into various companies (RH, Affirm, Xponential Fitness, Pony AI, HealthEquity, OSI Systems), which could indicate potential risks.

Actionable Strategies

Diversify Your Portfolio: Spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to mitigate risk.

Consider Defensive Sectors: Focus on sectors that are less sensitive to economic downturns, such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities.

Monitor Economic Indicators: Keep a close eye on key economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates.

Stay Informed on Policy Changes: Be aware of any changes in government policies, regulations, and trade agreements that could impact the markets.

Manage Risk: Use stop-loss orders and other risk management tools to protect your investments.

Consider Income-Generating Assets: Explore opportunities in bond ETFs and dividend-paying stocks to generate income in a volatile market.

Conclusion

The current financial market environment is characterized by heightened volatility, risk aversion, and economic uncertainty. By staying informed, adapting your investment strategies, and managing risk effectively, you can navigate these challenging conditions and position your portfolio for long-term success. Remember to consult with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

1k4cz4r,TickerTalkByLiam,Why $MYNZ (Mainz Biomed) Might Be the Practical Middle Ground in Early Cancer Detection,"With all the buzz around **multi-cancer early detection (MCED)** blood tests and AI-driven diagnostics, it’s worth spotlighting a smaller company taking a more grounded, clinically validated approach to a very real problem: colorectal cancer.

**Mainz Biomed ($MYNZ)** is developing a non-invasive stool-based test, **ColoAlert®**, that blends **mRNA biomarkers with PCR and FIT testing** to detect **early-stage colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas**. Unlike experimental MCEDs or AI methods that still face reproducibility or cost challenges, MYNZ is focused on:

* Real-world, patient-friendly screening
* High clinical sensitivity (97% for CRC, 82% for advanced adenomas)
* Already commercialized in parts of Europe

🧪 **Why it matters now**:  
MCEDs like Galleri and CancerSEEK are innovative, but they show mixed results - positive predictive values under 40% and difficulty detecting early-stage disease. Meanwhile, MYNZ is already showing 100% sensitivity in high-grade dysplasia - the exact lesions you want to catch early.

🚀 With a U.S.-based pivotal trial underway (eAArly DETECT 2), and partnerships with **Thermo Fisher** and **Quest Diagnostics**, MYNZ is positioning itself not as the flashiest, but maybe the most **clinically viable** player for population-wide screening - at a fraction of the cost of MCEDs or AI-based diagnostics.

As AI and MCED tech evolve, MYNZ might just bridge the gap with **scalable, proven tech** ready for near-term adoption.

1k3xfct,u_TradingAllIn,Briefing for Monday and the upcoming week in US markets,"# Market Summary & Outlook - Week of April 21, 2025

**Overall TL;DR:**

>Markets enter the week cautious after recent tariff-induced volatility. Focus shifts to a heavy earnings slate (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META) and key economic data (Flash PMIs, GDP, PCE inflation). Ongoing US-China trade tensions and Middle East geopolitical risks remain significant background concerns, impacting oil, tech, and safe-haven assets. Fed commentary remains data-dependent amidst conflicting signals from recent economic reports.

# Weekend News Summary and Assessment (Primarily April 19-20, 2025)

**TL;DR:**

>Trade policy uncertainty persists as the major overhang, while Middle East tensions simmer, potentially impacting oil. No major new Fed signals emerged over the weekend. Congress averted an immediate shutdown, pushing funding deadlines to September.

* **Political Developments:**
   * **Trump's Tariff Policies:** Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's recent imposition of broad tariffs remains the dominant theme driving market volatility and global economic growth concerns. While some exemptions were noted previously, the overall policy stance keeps trade relations tense, particularly with China. Existing high tariffs on specific items like Chinese EVs and solar panels add to the complex trade landscape. Rumors of potential new sanctions targeting Chinese tech firms persist amid these tensions.
   * **Investor Sentiment:** The unpredictable nature of trade policy continues to foster caution, with some analyses noting reduced investor confidence in US assets and lower economic approval ratings for the administration linked to tariff impacts.
   * **Middle East Escalation:** Ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza and reported Iran-backed group activity continue. While no major weekend escalation significantly shifted oil markets pre-open, the situation remains tense, supporting oil prices and demand for safe-haven assets like gold. OPEC+ continues monitoring the situation.
   * **China-Taiwan Tensions:** Naval exercises were noted, keeping this geopolitical flashpoint relevant background noise.
   * **US Government Funding:** Congress passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) in March, funding the government through September 30, 2025. This removes the immediate threat of a shutdown but sets the stage for FY 2026 budget negotiations later this year.
* **Global Economic News:** China's Q1 GDP (reported previously) met expectations. Bank of Japan officials continue signaling potential rate normalization. Recent softer UK inflation data keeps BOE policy options open. Weaker German industrial data highlights European growth challenges.
* **US Macro News:**
   * **Inflation Data:** Last week's March CPI data showed a slight cooling (Headline 3.4%, Core 3.6%), initially boosting hopes for a Fed pause/cut. Focus now shifts intensely to this Friday's March PCE Price Index (the Fed's preferred measure) for confirmation.
   * **Retail Sales:** Weak March retail sales data (reported last week) contrasted with prior strong readings and a relatively robust labor market, adding complexity to the economic picture and softening the ""higher-for-longer"" Fed narrative for some.
   * **Fed Speakers:** No major new signals emerged over the weekend. Recent comments (Williams, Bostic, Powell last week) reiterated a ""data-dependent"" stance, acknowledging tariff impacts, showing little urgency to cut rates but also deeming further hikes unlikely *at this moment*. The Fed remains watchful of incoming data, particularly inflation.

# Last Week's Major Items and Impact on Upcoming Week

**TL;DR:**

>Tariff whiplash dominated last week, leading to lower index closes despite intra-week volatility. Mixed economic data (cooler CPI, weak retail) fuels Fed policy debate. Earnings season begins, with upcoming reports crucial for market direction.

* **Tariff Turmoil:** The primary driver was the market digesting Trump's tariff actions and China's retaliations. This volatility is expected to persist, with sensitivity to any new trade headlines.
* **Economic Data Dichotomy:** Softer CPI and weak retail sales data boosted rate cut speculation, countered by underlying wage pressures and a still-tight labor market. This week's GDP and PCE data will be critical in shaping the Fed narrative.
* **Earnings Season Kickoff:** Initial earnings were mixed. The upcoming week features a high concentration of influential reports, which will heavily dictate sector and overall market performance.
* **Market Action:** Major indices (SPY, DIA) closed lower for the week, while small caps (IWM) showed relative strength. Gold (GLD) rallied strongly, oil (USO) gained, and bonds (AGG) saw mild selling.

# Impact of Weekend News on Monday Market Open

**TL;DR:**

>Expect a cautious open. Relief from lack of major weekend shocks may be offset by ongoing trade uncertainty and anticipation of key earnings/data. Middle East tensions support oil/energy, while US-China friction pressures tech.

* Ongoing Middle East tensions likely provide continued support for oil prices (WTI, Brent) and energy stocks (XLE). Safe-haven demand for gold (XAU/USD) may persist.
* Persistent US-China trade and tech tensions could weigh on semiconductor (SMH, SOXX) and China-related stocks (KWEB, MCHI).
* Avoiding a government shutdown provides near-term stability but isn't a major bullish catalyst.
* Focus will rapidly shift to Tuesday's Flash PMIs and key earnings like TSLA. Futures (ES\_F, NQ\_F) direction pre-market will be indicative.

# Stocks, ETFs, Commodities, Futures, and Expected Impact

**TL;DR:**

>Tech earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META) are pivotal. Energy and Defense may benefit from geopolitics. Gold remains a key safe haven. Watch Treasuries react to inflation data (PCE).

* **Stocks:**
   * **Energy** (XOM, CVX, SLB, HAL, OXY, MPC, APA, DVN, FANG, COP, PSX): Potential upside from geopolitical risk premium, OPEC+ vigilance.

   * **Technology** (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, INTC, GOOGL, META, SMCI, AVGO, AMAT, LRCX, QCOM, ON, KLAC, TEAM, HUBS): High focus on earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META). Sensitive to US-China tensions. NVDA earnings (likely later) still cast a shadow. GOOGL also watched for antitrust news.
   * **Retail/Consumer** (TGT, WMT, HD, COST, MCD, KO, NKE, PTON, ETSY, COTY, XLY, XLP): Earnings and outlooks key for gauging consumer health.
   * **Financials** (JPM, BAC, WFC, GS, CMA, BOH, KRE, KBE, COF, XLF, HBAN): Focus on earnings, net interest margin outlooks. Regionals (KRE) remain under scrutiny.
   * **Industrials** (CAT, GE, BA, MMM, DE, HON, XLI): Sensitive to trade, economic cycle. Key earnings due (GE, BA, LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, MMM).
   * **Chinese ADRs** (BABA, PDD, NIO, LI, BIDU, JD, TCEHY, YUMC, NTES): Vulnerable to tariffs and geopolitical friction.
   * **Healthcare** (UNH, LLY, MRK, BMY, ABBV, HCA, ELV, MOH, HUM, CNC, CVS): Sector rotation, drug pipelines, earnings (MRK, BMY, ABBV, HCA) are key.
   * **Semiconductors** (NVDA, AMD, INTC, SMH, SOXX, AVGO, AMAT, LRCX, QCOM, ON, KLAC): Volatile; key earnings (INTC), demand outlook, China tensions.
   * **Other notables:** LLY (drug news), PYPL (payments), ENPH (solar), DAL, AAL, LUV (airlines), LEN, DHI (housing), ADM, BG, CF, CMP, IPI, MOS (agriculture/chemicals).
* **ETFs:**
   * **Broad Market** (SPY, QQQ, DIA, IWM, IUXX, SPX): Reflecting overall sentiment.
   * **Sector Specific** (XLE, USO, OIH, XLI, XLB, XLK, XLU, XLC, XLY, XLP, XLF, XRT, KBE, KRE): Tracking sector performance.
   * **Thematic/International** (SMH, SOXX, KWEB, MCHI, REMX, EZU): Following specific themes/regions.
   * **Bonds** (TLT, AGG, IEF, SHY): Reacting to inflation, Fed expectations, flight-to-safety.
   * **Volatility** (VIX, VXX): Sensitive to uncertainty, data surprises.
   * **Commodity** (GLD, IAU, SLV, GDX, CPER, DBA, WEAT, OIL): Tracking underlying commodity moves.
* **Commodities:**
   * **Crude Oil** (WTI, Brent, CL\_F): Supported by Middle East risk, watch inventories. Key resistance/support levels watched.
   * **Gold** (XAU/USD, GC\_F, GLD): Key safe haven; sensitive to yields, dollar (DXY), geopolitics. Holding above 2,400 is constructive. Miners (NEM, AEM, GOLD, GDX, AU) may leverage gains.
   * **Copper** (HG\_F, CPER): Global growth proxy, sensitive to China and trade.
   * **Silver** (XAG/USD, SLV): Following precious metals trend, industrial demand component.
   * **Agricultural** (WEAT, DBA, Wheat, Corn, Soybeans): Geopolitics (Ukraine), weather, supply chains are factors. Wheat (WEAT) potential breakout near 6.50/bu noted.
* **Futures:**
   * **Index Futures** (ES\_F, NQ\_F, YM\_F, ESM25, NQM25): Real-time direction; watching technical levels (e.g., S&P 4,800 support mentioned previously).
   * **VIX Futures** (VX\_F): Forward volatility expectations.
   * **Treasury Futures** (ZN\_F, ZB\_F, ZNM25): Interest rate and inflation expectations.

>Relatively stable weekend for majors (BTC \~$84.5k-$85k). Focus may shift to potential SEC decisions on spot ETH ETFs this week.

* Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) showed minor fluctuations over the weekend. Other majors like Litecoin (LTC) and XRP (XRP) saw modest moves.
* Regulatory watch: Potential SEC updates on spot Ethereum ETFs could be a catalyst. News about Schwab's spot trading plans and potential US gov't Bitcoin reserves also percolating.
* Crypto-related stocks (COIN, MSTR, MARA) and ETFs (BITO) remain highly correlated to BTC price action.

# Legal Summary

**TL;DR:**

>Google's antitrust issues remain a focus. Broader tariff uncertainty is the main legal/political overhang. No major Supreme Court tech liability ruling expected this week.

* The Google (GOOGL) ad tech monopoly ruling continues to be relevant. Ongoing DOJ antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech (GOOGL, AMZN) persists.
* The dominant legal/political factor impacting markets remains the uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and tariffs.
* Previous major Supreme Court rulings on tech platform liability (Section 230) occurred in 2023, largely maintaining the status quo. No similar landmark decision is imminent this week.

# Highest Expected Volatility Items

**TL;DR:**

>Tech earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META), US GDP & PCE data, Fed speak (Powell Wed), and any significant tariff/geopolitical developments are the top volatility drivers.

* **Key Earnings Releases:** TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META guidance/results.
* **US Economic Data:** Flash PMIs (Tue), Q1 GDP (Thu), PCE Inflation (Fri).
* **US Trade Policy:** Any updates on tariffs or US-China relations.
* **Fed Communications:** Powell (Wed), Waller (Mon/Thu), and other officials' comments on policy path.
* **Geopolitics:** Middle East developments impacting oil (WTI, Brent) and risk sentiment.
* **Sector Specific:** Semiconductors (SMH, SOXX) due to earnings and macro sensitivity.

1k1226d,mauerstrassenwetten,#146 Preisanpassungskraft auf Pinguine und dessen fehlgeschlagene Haier Arbitrage,"Auch diese Woche stürzen sich die lahmen Enten für euch in das Aktuelle Politik und Markt Chaos und berichten für euch über sechs gecharterte Flugzeuge mit 600 Tonnen I-Telefonen welche von Indien aus nach Fettbürgerland fliegen. Wir reden auch über die Imp/Export Politik von Heard und $MCD Insel und wieso unsere Lieblings Pinguine jetzt doch kein Surplus mehr im Handel mit der Orangenhaut haben. Wir besprechen weshalb sowohl Jan Hatzius und Marc Gebauer für uns absolute Traumpodcastgäste wären.

1jwz8m2,StockMarket,"Week Recap: The stock market had passed a highly volatile week and ended positive both daily and weekly. Is the worst behind us? Apr. 4, 2025 - Apr. 11, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Apr. 4 to Apr. 11. 

I had the same question that ""Is the worst behind us?"" in March 15. The S&P 500 closed 5,638.94 that week. And today, it has closed at 5,358.75. But this time, could it be different?

It has been a busy week, and also a highly volatile one. The S&P500's daily closing percentages were -0.23%, -1.57%, +9.52%, -3.46%, +1.72%.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: Last week, we saw major losses after the tariff announcements. Asian markets opened with heavy selling pressure. The Hang Seng Index dropped 13% in a single day. Thailand temporarily banned short selling of stocks. This week started under similar pressure. Althouth there was no major news for the market, but it rebounded and recovered more than 3% its loses. The day ended slightly negative. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, ""Up to 70 nations want to negotiate over Trump's tariffs"". This boosted the market and opened up by around 2.5%. However, the momentum could not continue. The White House later announced that Trump is not considering any extensions or delays. All gains were erased and the market dropped more than 1.5% 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Here we go. The stock market opened slightly lower and then came big news. Trump signaled a 90-day pause on tariffs, but China's tariff rate will jump to 125%. The stock market focused on the first part and made a huge jump and gained more than 10%. What a day. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: CPI inflation was released and came in below expectations, but investors remembered China's tarrifs and took profits. The stock market lost more than 3%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: PPI inflation had released and similar to CPI, it came below expectations. The monthly expectation was 0.2%, but it came -0.4%. This result caused to the yearly rate to drop to 2.7%. The yearly dropped below 3% since November 2024. This is very positive for the stock market because it increases the chances of more rate cuts. The first one could come in May, but prohability is still low. On the negative side, The US10Y (10-year treasury) hit 4.60 and the highest level since Feb. 13. The stock market is expecting the first rate cut in June. The last day of the week ended on a positive. 🟢

The 2-week losing streak has ended. Week by week,

On Monday, the S&P 500 hit its lowest level of this week at 4,835.04. Was that the dip? I saw a tariff alert on a news app on Wednesday and I bought around 5150.

1k60ifb,Options_Beginners,CMG Earnings,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has been a hot topic among investors, especially around its earnings reports. Here's a guide to understanding the key points and sentiments from Redditors about CMG's earnings and stock performance:

# Key Factors Influencing CMG's Stock Price

* **Vertical Integration and Ownership**:
   * Chipotle owns and operates all its locations, unlike many franchise models. This vertical integration means the company captures more value through real estate, leases, and equipment ownership. [""Chipotle owns and operates all of its own locations, unlike most franchise stocks.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8rwq8/comment/iyf56ys/)
* **Institutional Ownership**:
   * A significant portion of CMG's stock is held by institutions, which can prop up the stock price. [""The main factor that props CMG's price is the 96.3% institutional ownership.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8rwq8/comment/iycz1oe/)
* **Share Float**:
   * The number of shares available for trading is relatively low, which can lead to higher volatility and price movements. [""Microscopic float - 27,721,112 shares outstanding.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/z8rwq8/comment/iyd99fa/)

# Recent Earnings and Market Reactions

* **Earnings Beats and Stock Movements**:
   * Chipotle has had instances where it beat earnings expectations, leading to significant stock price movements. [""Chipotle earnings performed marvelously while its peers are suffering.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fktsus/comment/lnyabjh/)
   * However, the stock can be volatile post-earnings, with some investors experiencing losses due to market reactions. [""Me: Buys calls pre-earnings... crashes all the way back down by market open.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ebggst/comment/levc6fg/)

# Long-Term Growth and Valuation Concerns

* **Growth Potential**:
   * Chipotle plans to double its current size and expand internationally, which could drive future growth. [""The company plans to grow to double its current size and internationally.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dyfzln/comment/lc8hymp/)
   * Despite this, some investors believe the stock is currently overpriced, with growth already priced in. [""It's just too expensive, their growth rate that's priced in is not realistic.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fktsus/comment/lny2yr8/)
* **Stock Splits and Market Sentiment**:
   * The recent stock split has made CMG more accessible to retail investors, but it has also led to increased shorting and options trading. [""With the lower price per share it now becomes cheaper for people to play options on Chipotle and also to short it.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dyfl6f/comment/lcapn9o/)

# Investor Sentiments and Strategies

* **Mixed Opinions on Valuation**:
   * Some investors are cautious about CMG's high valuation ratios, comparing it to tech stocks rather than traditional restaurant chains. [""It’s trading at a 53.3x EV/EBITDA multiple LTM and 42.9x NTM.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dyfl6f/comment/lc8rwxu/)
   * Others believe in the brand's strength and potential to outperform in the long run. [""Chipotle is lowkey a beast, their recovery has been wild.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1fktsus/comment/lny4pr1/)

# Conclusion

Chipotle's stock is influenced by its unique business model, significant institutional ownership, and growth plans. While it has shown strong performance and potential for future growth, its high valuation and recent stock split have led to mixed sentiments among investors. For those considering investing in CMG, it's essential to weigh these factors and stay updated on market reactions to earnings reports.",cmg earnings,chipotle mexican grill cmg hot topic among investors especially around earnings reports heres guide understanding key points sentiments redditors cmgs earnings stock performance key factors influencing cmgs stock price vertical integration ownership chipotle owns operates locations unlike many franchise models vertical integration means company captures value real estate leases equipment ownership chipotle owns operates locations unlike franchise stockshttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentszrwqcommentiyfys institutional ownership significant portion cmgs stock held institutions prop stock price main factor props cmgs price institutional ownershiphttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentszrwqcommentiyczoe share float number shares available trading relatively low lead higher volatility price movements microscopic float shares outstandinghttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentszrwqcommentiydfa recent earnings market reactions earnings beats stock movements chipotle instances beat earnings expectations leading significant stock price movements chipotle earnings performed marvelously peers sufferinghttpswwwredditcomrvalueinvestingcommentsfktsuscommentlnyabjh however stock volatile postearnings investors experiencing losses due market reactions buys calls preearnings crashes way back market openhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsebggstcommentlevcfg longterm growth valuation concerns growth potential chipotle plans double current size expand internationally could drive future growth company plans grow double current size internationallyhttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentsdyfzlncommentlchymp despite investors believe stock currently overpriced growth already priced expensive growth rate thats priced realistichttpswwwredditcomrvalueinvestingcommentsfktsuscommentlnyyr stock splits market sentiment recent stock split made cmg accessible retail investors also led increased shorting options trading lower price per share becomes cheaper people play options chipotle also short ithttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsdyflfcommentlcapno investor sentiments strategies mixed opinions valuation investors cautious cmgs high valuation ratios comparing tech stocks rather traditional restaurant chains trading x evebitda multiple ltm x ntmhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsdyflfcommentlcrwxu others believe brands strength potential outperform long run chipotle lowkey beast recovery wildhttpswwwredditcomrvalueinvestingcommentsfktsuscommentlnypr conclusion chipotles stock influenced unique business model significant institutional ownership growth plans shown strong performance potential future growth high valuation recent stock split led mixed sentiments among investors considering investing cmg essential weigh factors stay updated market reactions earnings reports,1.0,,['CMG'],negative,0.9992378,neutral,0.9958723187446594

Developments in artificial intelligence on a single day in April 2025 encompassed ambitious goals like automating all human jobs alongside practical applications such as an AI tool gaining FDA breakthrough status for cancer detection. Challenges also emerged, demonstrated by an AI coding assistant fabricating a policy and a new phishing scam bypassing Gmail security. Simultaneously, efforts to democratise technology progressed through no-code web development platforms, while research explored more advanced AI learning methods. The impact of AI was evident in concerns over reduced website traffic due to Google's AI overviews and in its potential for social networking, wildlife conservation, and youth sports.

# 🤖 [AI Startup Plans to Replace All Human Workers](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/famed-ai-researcher-launches-controversial-startup-to-replace-all-human-workers-everywhere/)

Mechanize, a new startup founded by AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu, aims to automate every human job using AI agents. The company has attracted significant investment, including from Jeff Dean and Nat Friedman, and plans to develop AI systems capable of performing tasks across various industries.

* The company plans to create simulations of workplace scenarios to train AI agents in handling complex, long-term tasks currently performed by humans.
* Mechanize will initially focus on automating white-collar jobs, with systems that can manage computer tasks, handle interruptions, and coordinate with others.
* Backed by tech leaders including Jeff Dean and Nat Friedman, the startup estimates its potential market at $60T globally.
* The announcement drew criticism for both the economic implications and potential conflicts with Besiroglu's role at AI research firm Epoch.

What this means: This initiative intensifies the debate on AI's role in the workforce, raising questions about employment, ethics, and the future of human labor. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/04/21](https://djamgatech.web.app/)\]

Alibaba's Damo Academy has received the FDA's ""breakthrough device"" designation for its AI tool, Damo Panda, designed to detect early-stage pancreatic cancer. This status will expedite the tool's review and approval process, potentially leading to earlier diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.

# 🧠 [DeepMind's Shift to 'Experiential' AI Learning](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-has-grown-beyond-human-knowledge-says-googles-deepmind-unit/)

https://preview.redd.it/q72mveq9gewe1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd65ebe1175c991d7e0dfa52832ae6bc1499c8b

Google's DeepMind is transitioning from traditional data-driven AI models to an experiential learning approach, allowing AI to learn from interactions with the environment. This method aims to enhance AI's adaptability and understanding.

* Authored by RL legends David Silver and Richard Sutton, the paper argues that human data training caps AI's potential and prevents truly new discoveries.
* Streams would allow AI to learn continuously with extended interactions rather than brief Q&A exchanges, enabling adaptation and improvement over time.
* AI agents would use real-world signals like health metrics, exam scores, and environmental data as feedback, rather than relying on human evaluations.
* The approach builds on techniques that helped systems like AlphaZero master games, expanding them to handle open-ended real-world scenarios.
* The researchers suggest this shift could enable AI to discover solutions beyond current human knowledge while still maintaining adaptable safety measures.

What this means: Experiential learning could lead to more robust AI systems capable of handling complex, real-world scenarios with greater autonomy. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/04/21](https://djamgatech.web.app/)\]

A sophisticated phishing scam is exploiting Google's own tools to send deceptive emails that appear to come from ""[no-reply@google.com](mailto:no-reply@google.com),"" warning recipients of fake subpoenas. The attack bypasses standard security checks, prompting Google to implement countermeasures and advise users to enable two-factor authentication.

What this means: This incident highlights vulnerabilities in email security systems and the need for enhanced protective measures against evolving phishing tactics. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/04/21](https://djamgatech.web.app/)\]

# 💥 [Meta Is Ramping Up Its AI-Driven Age Detection](https://www.theverge.com/news/651826/meta-instagram-age-detection-ai-settings)

Meta is enhancing its AI systems to detect underage users on Instagram who misrepresent their age. The platform will proactively identify and adjust accounts suspected of belonging to teens, enforcing stricter privacy settings and content limitations to protect younger users.

* Meta is employing artificial intelligence to identify young users on Instagram who falsely claim to be adults, automatically placing them into more restricted Teen Accounts for safety.
* These special Teen Accounts automatically apply safeguards limiting interactions and the type of content viewable by users verified as being younger than eighteen years old.
* The social media giant is also educating parents about discussing age verification online and recently expanded this protective account system to Facebook and Messenger platforms.

What this means: This move reflects growing efforts to safeguard minors online, though it also raises concerns about privacy and the accuracy of AI-driven age assessments. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/04/21](https://djamgatech.web.app/)\]

# 📉 [Data Reveals Google AI Overviews Drain Clicks from Websites](https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-hurt-click-through-rates-454428)

Recent studies indicate that Google's AI-generated overviews in search results are significantly reducing click-through rates to traditional websites, with declines ranging from 15% to over 60% depending on the query type. This trend is causing concern among publishers and content creators who rely on organic traffic.

* New research from Ahrefs reveals Google's AI Overviews are causing a substantial 34.5% decrease in clicks for the premier organic search listings, challenging the platform's claims.
* Ahrefs' research, analyzing 300,000 primarily informational queries via Google Search Console, documented a significant fall in user clicks for the highest-ranked organic search result.
* This pattern suggests continued erosion of direct website traffic, potentially altering the web's structure and forcing content creators to comply with platform rules for visibility.

What this means: The shift towards AI-generated search summaries may necessitate new strategies for online visibility and raises questions about the future of web traffic distribution. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/04/21](https://djamgatech.web.app/)\]

1k54kj1,Badboyardie,The morning market indicator," Earnings Season Insights


Verizon (VZ): The telecom giant is set to report. Analysts are looking for stable growth in its infrastructure and continued expansion of its 5G network. A strong report could boost the entire telecom sector. Signal: Expect potentially positive premarket movement in the telecom sector, particularly if guidance is optimistic.

Tesla (TSLA): All eyes are on Tesla as it reports amid increased competition and concerns about production output. Market sentiment is highly sensitive to any news regarding production numbers and future guidance. Signal: Expect volatile premarket movement in the tech and automotive sectors. A negative report could drag down other EV stocks, while a positive report could fuel a broader tech rally.


VZ: A steady performance from Verizon could help to stabilize market sentiment, especially if it confirms the resilience of more traditional sectors.

TSLA: Given Tesla's high profile, its earnings report has the potential to dictate the direction of growth stocks in the near term. Disappointment could trigger a wider sell-off, while a strong showing could renew confidence in the growth narrative.


Federal Reserve Interest Rate Decision

The primary focus will be on any forward guidance provided by Fed speakers Harker, Kashkari, and Barkin. Their comments will be scrutinized for clues about the future path of monetary policy. Signal: Expect continued sideways movement in interest-rate-sensitive sectors as the market digests the implications of the Fed's stance.

Implications for Traders:

Markets are likely to be highly reactive to any hawkish or dovish signals from Fed officials. Strategy: Keep a close watch on fixed income markets and be prepared for quick shifts in asset allocation based on the Fed's commentary.



Geopolitical Events


Rising global tensions are adding to market uncertainty. Investors are closely monitoring geopolitical developments for any signs of escalation. Signal: Expect increased volatility and a potential flight to safety into assets like gold and U.S. Treasury bonds.


Performance Overview:

Top Performers: Energy (XLE) and Utilities (XLU) are showing relative strength as investors seek defensive positions. Signal: Strength in defensive sectors suggests a risk-off sentiment.

Underperformers: Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are underperforming as growth prospects are questioned. Signal: Weakness in growth-oriented sectors indicates concerns about future economic expansion.

1k3xfct,u_TradingAllIn,Briefing for Monday and the upcoming week in US markets,"# Market Summary & Outlook - Week of April 21, 2025

**Overall TL;DR:**

>Markets enter the week cautious after recent tariff-induced volatility. Focus shifts to a heavy earnings slate (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META) and key economic data (Flash PMIs, GDP, PCE inflation). Ongoing US-China trade tensions and Middle East geopolitical risks remain significant background concerns, impacting oil, tech, and safe-haven assets. Fed commentary remains data-dependent amidst conflicting signals from recent economic reports.

# Weekend News Summary and Assessment (Primarily April 19-20, 2025)

**TL;DR:**

>Trade policy uncertainty persists as the major overhang, while Middle East tensions simmer, potentially impacting oil. No major new Fed signals emerged over the weekend. Congress averted an immediate shutdown, pushing funding deadlines to September.

* **Political Developments:**
   * **Trump's Tariff Policies:** Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's recent imposition of broad tariffs remains the dominant theme driving market volatility and global economic growth concerns. While some exemptions were noted previously, the overall policy stance keeps trade relations tense, particularly with China. Existing high tariffs on specific items like Chinese EVs and solar panels add to the complex trade landscape. Rumors of potential new sanctions targeting Chinese tech firms persist amid these tensions.
   * **Investor Sentiment:** The unpredictable nature of trade policy continues to foster caution, with some analyses noting reduced investor confidence in US assets and lower economic approval ratings for the administration linked to tariff impacts.
   * **Middle East Escalation:** Ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza and reported Iran-backed group activity continue. While no major weekend escalation significantly shifted oil markets pre-open, the situation remains tense, supporting oil prices and demand for safe-haven assets like gold. OPEC+ continues monitoring the situation.
   * **China-Taiwan Tensions:** Naval exercises were noted, keeping this geopolitical flashpoint relevant background noise.
   * **US Government Funding:** Congress passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) in March, funding the government through September 30, 2025. This removes the immediate threat of a shutdown but sets the stage for FY 2026 budget negotiations later this year.
* **Global Economic News:** China's Q1 GDP (reported previously) met expectations. Bank of Japan officials continue signaling potential rate normalization. Recent softer UK inflation data keeps BOE policy options open. Weaker German industrial data highlights European growth challenges.
* **US Macro News:**
   * **Inflation Data:** Last week's March CPI data showed a slight cooling (Headline 3.4%, Core 3.6%), initially boosting hopes for a Fed pause/cut. Focus now shifts intensely to this Friday's March PCE Price Index (the Fed's preferred measure) for confirmation.
   * **Retail Sales:** Weak March retail sales data (reported last week) contrasted with prior strong readings and a relatively robust labor market, adding complexity to the economic picture and softening the ""higher-for-longer"" Fed narrative for some.
   * **Fed Speakers:** No major new signals emerged over the weekend. Recent comments (Williams, Bostic, Powell last week) reiterated a ""data-dependent"" stance, acknowledging tariff impacts, showing little urgency to cut rates but also deeming further hikes unlikely *at this moment*. The Fed remains watchful of incoming data, particularly inflation.

# Last Week's Major Items and Impact on Upcoming Week

**TL;DR:**

>Tariff whiplash dominated last week, leading to lower index closes despite intra-week volatility. Mixed economic data (cooler CPI, weak retail) fuels Fed policy debate. Earnings season begins, with upcoming reports crucial for market direction.

* **Tariff Turmoil:** The primary driver was the market digesting Trump's tariff actions and China's retaliations. This volatility is expected to persist, with sensitivity to any new trade headlines.
* **Economic Data Dichotomy:** Softer CPI and weak retail sales data boosted rate cut speculation, countered by underlying wage pressures and a still-tight labor market. This week's GDP and PCE data will be critical in shaping the Fed narrative.
* **Earnings Season Kickoff:** Initial earnings were mixed. The upcoming week features a high concentration of influential reports, which will heavily dictate sector and overall market performance.
* **Market Action:** Major indices (SPY, DIA) closed lower for the week, while small caps (IWM) showed relative strength. Gold (GLD) rallied strongly, oil (USO) gained, and bonds (AGG) saw mild selling.

# Impact of Weekend News on Monday Market Open

**TL;DR:**

>Expect a cautious open. Relief from lack of major weekend shocks may be offset by ongoing trade uncertainty and anticipation of key earnings/data. Middle East tensions support oil/energy, while US-China friction pressures tech.

* Ongoing Middle East tensions likely provide continued support for oil prices (WTI, Brent) and energy stocks (XLE). Safe-haven demand for gold (XAU/USD) may persist.
* Persistent US-China trade and tech tensions could weigh on semiconductor (SMH, SOXX) and China-related stocks (KWEB, MCHI).
* Avoiding a government shutdown provides near-term stability but isn't a major bullish catalyst.
* Focus will rapidly shift to Tuesday's Flash PMIs and key earnings like TSLA. Futures (ES\_F, NQ\_F) direction pre-market will be indicative.

# Stocks, ETFs, Commodities, Futures, and Expected Impact

**TL;DR:**

>Tech earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META) are pivotal. Energy and Defense may benefit from geopolitics. Gold remains a key safe haven. Watch Treasuries react to inflation data (PCE).

* **Stocks:**
   * **Energy** (XOM, CVX, SLB, HAL, OXY, MPC, APA, DVN, FANG, COP, PSX): Potential upside from geopolitical risk premium, OPEC+ vigilance.
   * **Defense** (LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, LHX): May benefit from global tensions.
   * **Technology** (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, INTC, GOOGL, META, SMCI, AVGO, AMAT, LRCX, QCOM, ON, KLAC, TEAM, HUBS): High focus on earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META). Sensitive to US-China tensions. NVDA earnings (likely later) still cast a shadow. GOOGL also watched for antitrust news.
   * **Retail/Consumer** (TGT, WMT, HD, COST, MCD, KO, NKE, PTON, ETSY, COTY, XLY, XLP): Earnings and outlooks key for gauging consumer health.
   * **Financials** (JPM, BAC, WFC, GS, CMA, BOH, KRE, KBE, COF, XLF, HBAN): Focus on earnings, net interest margin outlooks. Regionals (KRE) remain under scrutiny.

1jxuwyh,Wavegenius,CMG to 140 in a Wave 3 Setup Long Term? Article,"# CMG: Preparing for a Wave 3 Surge?

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has been a standout performer in the fast-casual dining space, and its price action over the past several years paints a textbook Elliott Wave pattern. Over the last **7 years**, CMG has advanced in a clean **5-wave rally** from **$5 to $69**, likely completing a full **Wave 1** of a much larger secular bull market.

Now, after a technical pullback, the stock appears to be building the base for a **Wave 3 liftoff**—but it needs one more confirmation.

# Wave 2: ABC Zigzag Back to Prior Support

Following its impressive Wave 1 run, CMG recently pulled back in a standard **ABC zigzag correction**, retracing to the **$43–$44 range**—a level that aligns with prior Wave 4 support. This type of correction is both typical and healthy, allowing the market to reset sentiment and energy before the next leg higher.

This correction found support and has since seen a strong reversal, indicating that buyers are stepping back in. However, the rally is still in the early stages and needs to push above a key technical threshold to confirm the start of Wave 3.

# Breakout Zone: $63 is the Level to Watch

The critical resistance level now lies at **$63**, which is both the **.786 Fibonacci retracement** of the C wave decline and the **top of the B wave** from the ABC correction. A **decisive breakout above $63** would strongly suggest that Wave 2 has completed and that a powerful Wave 3 is about to begin.

Volume expansion and bullish follow-through would confirm the breakout, potentially drawing in both institutional and technical traders.

# Wave 3 Target: $135–$140

If CMG clears $63 and confirms the breakout, Elliott Wave theory points to a **Wave 3 target** between **$135 and $140**. This is based on a **1.618 Fibonacci extension** of the Wave 1 move—a common projection for Wave 3s, which tend to be the strongest and most impulsive leg in the cycle.

From current levels, that would represent **over a 2x return** from the breakout zone and more than **3x from the Wave 2 low**.

# Support and Risk Management

The **$43–$44 zone** now acts as major support. As long as CMG holds above this level, the bullish wave structure remains intact. A drop below this area could invalidate the current count and signal a more complex correction is unfolding.

For now, CMG is in a constructive technical position, and the breakout over $63 could open the door to explosive upside in the months and years ahead.",cmg wave setup long term article,cmg preparing wave surge chipotle mexican grill cmg standout performer fastcasual dining space price action past several years paints textbook elliott wave pattern last years cmg advanced clean wave rally likely completing full wave much larger secular bull market technical pullback stock appears building base wave liftoffbut needs one confirmation wave abc zigzag back prior support following impressive wave run cmg recently pulled back standard abc zigzag correction retracing rangea level aligns prior wave support type correction typical healthy allowing market reset sentiment energy next leg higher correction found support since seen strong reversal indicating buyers stepping back however rally still early stages needs push key technical threshold confirm start wave breakout zone level watch critical resistance level lies fibonacci retracement c wave decline top b wave abc correction decisive breakout would strongly suggest wave completed powerful wave begin volume expansion bullish followthrough would confirm breakout potentially drawing institutional technical traders wave target cmg clears confirms breakout elliott wave theory points wave target based fibonacci extension wave movea common projection wave tend strongest impulsive leg cycle current levels would represent x return breakout zone x wave low support risk management zone acts major support long cmg holds level bullish wave structure remains intact drop area could invalidate current count signal complex correction unfolding cmg constructive technical position breakout could open door explosive upside months years ahead,1.0,,['CMG'],negative,0.9995017,neutral,0.999969482421875

1jzflwh,Trading,"**Tariff Exclusions Spark Early Rally, But Gains Fade Late**","
**Monday Market Action**

 * Major indexes jumped on news that U.S. tariffs would temporarily exclude certain smartphones, computers, and semiconductor devices. The Nasdaq initially soared, then gave back over 400 points off its high as intraday selling pressure mounted. Fed Governor Waller said if average tariffs settle near 10%, inflation could peak at 3% – but lingering risk of higher levies (up to 5% inflation) tempered enthusiasm.

* The VIX dipped below 30 for the first time in 10 days as stocks ended with modest gains. Treasury yields eased (10-year ~4.36%) after last week’s 50-bps surge, while the dollar hovered near multi-year lows. Gold pulled back from record highs (down 0.56% to $3,226.30/oz) and WTI Crude inched up to $61.53/bbl.


**__Sector Highlights__**
 * **Retail & Consumer:** Best Buy (BBY) rose on partial electronics tariff exemptions; ULTA downgraded at Argus on consumer uncertainty; luxury retailers (CPRI, TPR, RL) dropped after LVMH’s fashion/leather sales missed.
 * **Autos & Lodging:** GM downgraded at DBAB on tariff cost uncertainty; Hyatt (H) cut to Sell at Goldman, which also trimmed Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) to Neutral.
 * **Energy & Industrials:** OPEC cut 2025–26 global oil demand forecasts. Palantir (PLTR) gained on a NATO AI contract.
 * **Financials:** Goldman Sachs (GS) posted better-than-expected earnings; approved a $40B buyback. KKR is buying OSTTRA for $3.1B.
 * **Biotech & Pharma:** Pfizer (PFE) halted development of danuglipron (weight-loss pill) after a liver injury signal. The news boosted peers (VKTX, GPCR, ALT, NVO).
 * **Tech & Semis:** Apple (AAPL) jumped on phone tariff relief, upgraded at KeyBanc. Intel (INTC) to sell 51% of Altera to Silver Lake at an $8.75B valuation. Cisco (CSCO), Amphenol (APH), and Coherent (COHR) cited by Citi as top AI data center picks.

**__Looking Ahead__**
 * Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday.
 * On the U.S. economic tap, retail sales data, due Wednesday, is forecast to have jumped 1.3% in March, compared to a modest 0.2% rise in February. Excluding sales of automobiles, retail sales is projected to have edged up 0.2% last month, after rising 0.3% in the prior month.
 * Among the most looked-out-for results, Netflix is reporting on Thursday. The streaming giant is expected to post a rise in revenue in the first quarter as it continues to add more subscribers to its lower-priced, ad-supported tier.

* The U.S. announced sweeping new tariffs in April 2025, including 34% on China, 20% on the EU, and a 10% baseline on all countries starting April 9. Additional country-specific tariffs include 24% on Japan, 26% on India, and 49% on Cambodia.
* These new tariffs represent a major shift from the 2023 U.S. trade-weighted average tariff of 2.2%, marking a significant policy reversal. China had a 3.0% average tariff in 2023, while India was much higher at 12.0%.
* Retaliation is likely, with the EU and others expected to increase their own tariffs in response. Countries like Taiwan (1.7%) and Japan (1.9%) previously kept tariffs low to promote trade but now face steep U.S. levies.

**Fed Chair Powell speaks out on the impacts of Trump’s tariffs** [link](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.YEKRhgvVMysIYbPuESktiOVw4S_du5RSs2emFlEprH8c5SX6talMr_1FhY6qSe_RpLN-bD08d0pdXMDu8ENtD3IGKBzsF3rsR4jprE1SfC_EKI47LEVVfe4IdDMXpMFdD7OY4dpxxRyGa8cd0T5ANzNXQWIQrwTzmdXDVA8iNPq_xyTkE5gFUncIKuEwDnqCgqppkqDPKczTgc7Qf1hdZ_2P3TjeWqI4UYUM6ALoTzDrYaVlrEA1SzPLlc7boibtwy6qk83BYfuJ6SW19FS68Ub2vrvOmnFGDsB9sJhFUyMDCTs9OtXN9l0Q-Z4QNKU_-Z3zjyBkVVrd_SPJr8ScUlQm-Jl_3_IsVNmSHRvpa1s/4fi/coalR6WaS7-yXJnRa8mSvQ/h11/h001.q27YYLhKq1WUSuMxYlOmL7gKT4u-pOlTfwzkXCUbC4I)

* Jerome Powell warned that Trump's global tariffs will likely drive inflation higher and slow economic growth more than expected. Some forecasts say inflation could rise by a full percentage point in 2025 due to the tariffs.
* The stock market dropped sharply after China announced a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports, with the Dow falling nearly 5%—its biggest single-day loss since June 2020. Investor confidence is falling, and expectations for employment growth are weakening.
* Mortgage rates hit a new year-to-date low as bond yields dropped from a flight to safety. Lower rates could offer short-term relief to the housing market, but future volatility remains tied to tariff resolution.

* Pending home sales dropped 5.2% year-over-year in major metros, with sharp declines in Jacksonville, Miami, Memphis, and Virginia Beach. Meanwhile, San Jose, Sacramento, and San Francisco saw slight increases as affordability improved or stabilized.
* Inventory rose for the 17th straight month, up 28.5% from a year ago, with Denver, San Jose, and Las Vegas leading gains. However, supply still lags pre-pandemic levels, especially in the Midwest and Northeast.
* The median list price held steady at $424,900, but 17.5% of listings had price cuts—the highest for March since 2016. Price reductions were most common in Phoenix, Tampa, and Jacksonville.

* Mortgage rates recently hit a year-to-date low, helping boost purchase applications, which saw a 9% year-over-year increase last week. If rates drop to around 6%, existing home sales are expected to grow meaningfully this year.
* Weekly pending sales rose to 367,776, beating both 2024 and 2023 numbers. New listings also jumped to 71,775 last week, showing sellers are returning as rates ease.
* Inventory grew from 675,558 to 691,197 in just one week, with price cuts hitting 35% of active listings. Despite modest projected home price growth of 1.77% for 2025, real price growth remains negative due to high rates and rising supply.

* More than 200,000 square feet of office and retail space in Santa Monica is being converted into classrooms for thousands of K-12 students displaced by the Palisades wildfire. The Water Garden, Colorado Center, and a former Sears building are now hosting schools like Calvary Christian, Village School, and Palisades Charter High.
* Santa Monica's office vacancy reached 31% in Q4 2024, prompting landlords to find creative reuse solutions. These temporary school leases are revitalizing commercial areas and bringing new energy to campuses that previously had high vacancy.
* The former Sears building near the Third Street Promenade is being adapted for 2,445 students at a cost of $11 million, funded mostly by insurance. The school holds a six-month lease with options to extend, offering quick recovery space for displaced students.

1k67etf,BBallShoes,Kobe 10 low review,"Alright this will probably the most thorough review of the kobe 10s you can find post 2019. 
I first bought these in 2018 and have well over 2.5k total play hours in these. Easily 3k if you include weights. Ive owned 3 pairs of these and two of them are still in my rotation today. I can confidently say these are the most underrated shoe of all time. I bought my first pair new for $180 and the other two pairs used for >100 each. Nowadays you can get a decent used example for about 90-120. Since ive been wearing these for so long expect input for weights and heights anywhere between 5’9” 170 to 6’7” 230. 

Fit (4.5/5) 
I would argue these have just as good lockdown fit as the 6s. The laces need to be put through the highest loop to get that and i would seriously recommend swapping laces to some that dont slip and untie themselves as much cause the stock ones have that issue a lot fsr. The upper isnt very stiff and it uses i think nike flywire that feels a lot better than the stuff on the 9s. The containment is perfect for my foot shape but  people with really narrow feet would benefit from maybe a half size down. When tied tight the shoe can be fully broken in in less than 7-10 hours, i lifted weights in them and that speeds up the process a lot. The toebox is quite good for my foot shape but its a little stiff right at the top so it pinches your feet a little bit at first, after time it wears down and goes away though. 10/10 comfort. 

Durability:(3.2/5) (.2 better than 4s) 
Its a kobe shoe, what can you really do lol. My first pair is still useable today (almost 8 years later) but the traction on the outsole is not what it used to be. On my second pair the middle area of mesh ripped all the way through only like a month in to owning them. If you buy used, try to get pictures of the sides from inside and outside and real close to check for little tears. Ive heard some people criticize the midsole area for cracking over time, i havent really experienced that but i use my shoes a lot (abour 5ish hours a week nowadays but more like 12-15 for the first couple years of owning them) so i think that constantly working the rubber keeps that from happening. The zoom unit is still intact on all three pairs and has lost only a little bounce over time (still worth noting for used pairs). The outsole separated a little bit on the 2018 pair but i glued it back in like 10 minutes and i havent had an issue since. On the second pair (shitty ones from ebay) the lower outsole blew off them during a game, once i glued it back they were good though. The upper area around the ankle rubs off over time but it dosent affect performance at all and if you have good socks it probably wont even happen. If the zoom unit pops ur cooked though, the outsole is attached directly to it so itll warp something nasty and be mostly unusable (the highs are WAAY more prone to this than the lows). 

Versatility: (5/5) 
The only shoe id ever say can be worn by a short guard and a big and have the same effectiveness (except maybe harden 9s but the jury seems to still be out on those) 
The traction is good enough for a shifty guard to get to his spots fast, the little carbon bit at the top is great for run speed and decent for jumping so 4s will love these. The traction goes decently far up the heel so big guys need to worry less about achilles problems from awkward landings. The base is really wide (dosent affect fit) so lateral jumps have a lot of stability which is great for guys like me who like catching lobs and dunking. Even when i was shorter and lighter i still found them real bouncy, and as i got taller and heavier i more appreciated the comfort of the softer foam and still got explosiveness from the zoom units.

Performance: (4.5/5)
So much better than the 9s in every way. The traction is top tier and even on dusty courts i never slip at all (still wipe occasionally but marginally less than most other shoes). Like i said earlier the cushion is soft but still has really nice zoom units for bounce, which means you can jump high and have minimal instant pain coming down, good on the knees. I love the lateral movement i can get in these, im not a crazy ball handler but if im just messing around and doing some tuff combos i never really worry about twisting my ankles in these, really a plus over a lot of shoes. Ive seen people hate on the lack of a full shank and thats valid, i think a full shank woulda been nice but the little one mostly gets the job done. Backpeddaling feels unusually nice in these cause the heels are the slightest bit softer than the toe area which is good for getting back to spots faster. But, like most 10 year old shoes, the zoom/cushion is a little outdated vs something newer like a gt cut so if your used to that it might be too soft at first. 

Overall these are the most underrated shoe oat. People hate on any non 4,5,6 kobe but these are seriously just as good. Overall im gonna give them a 4.3/5. A protro with new tech would be soo good. One final thing. DO NOT BUY THE HIGHS THEY ARE WORSE IN EVERY WAY AND WILL BREAK AND RUIN YOUR ANKLES.

Careful with the electronic step sides. When I pushed the button to move one toward the bed, it got hung up on my back tire and shutdown to where I couldn’t get it to close. Had to unbolt and slide them about 1.5” forward to get them to clear the back and front tires. 
Thanks to everyone in this sub for the advice! Super happy with how everything turned out.

1k67l52,u_DeciduousMath12,"Spent a lot of time on this comment, and wanted to make these points in a more accessible post.","If you can't see why anyone would think that Harris was better than Trump, then you're very likely in a misinformation bubble (or if you want to be more polite about it, information bubble). If you go to Fox News, it's amazing how all of the posts are ""democrats bad"". ""Trump good"" ""Random liberal city council person says something outrageous"". ""Trump attended this one ceremony where he respected this one soldier"". Right now, the top headline is ""Trump admin files charges after FOX News exposes state's plan for illegal who killed American teens"". Anyone who only drinks this stuff may wonder how anyone could vote democratic. 

But then you go to reality. Is the TOP headline today about one random undocumented person that did a murder? That's what the entire country of 370 million people should focus on as the top headline? One murderer? Or is that being pushed because it furthers a narrative of ""immigrants bad"", when instead most people in the country are focused on something else. CNN: ""Trump accuses Zelenksy of prolonging war"". (admittedly, this is up there on Fox too). NYT: same. 2nd headline: Stocks rally on WH tariff comments. WAPO: ""Top aides urge Trump to dial back attacks on Fed ..."". WSJ: ""White House Considers Slashing Its Steep Tariffs on China**""**. HuffingtonPost: ""Judge rips Trump admin acting in bad faith"". 

On the other hand, I can at least see why people would vote for Trump. If all you do is watch Fox news and hear about all of these criminal immigrants, and gangs, committing crimes in the U.S. (again, a country of millions of people), you'll likely find something to talk about most days, and then you hear Trump talking about deportation, you see the planes going to Guantanamo, and Kristi Noem doing her propaganda in front of the El Salvadorian prison, I can understand the relief that finally the appearance is something is being done. 

<Well, why are you in favor of criminal immigrants?>  
I'm not. I'm more worried about schizophrenic trade policy that changes every day by the tweet, with no strategy. I'm more worried about Trump rounding people up, without a trial, and sending them off to another country for appearances. <but they're criminals.> Without a trial, anyone can accuse anyone of anything and suddenly they're a victim being flown off without due process. If the law doesn't protect immigrants (undocumented or otherwise), then it doesn't protect anyone. To say nothing that most immigrants are good for communities economically, commit less crime than U.S. citizens, and in general are lovely hard working people. Obviously not exclusively, because again, with millions of people, even a 0.1% rate of criminality will yield 1000s of bad people. That doesn't mean the other 99.9% should be tortured in a foreign prison because Fox news made you scared of them.

But to wrap it up - if you want to understand why people vote for Democrats, then I recommend you read Huffpost, top 3 articles a day, for a while, and you may begin to see a better balance of ineptitudes of the MAGA party and, occasionally, how a liberal policy is helping people.

>Chart I reveals the linear connection between the **Rothschilds** and the Bank of England, and the London banking houses which ultimately control the Federal Reserve Banks through their stockholdings of bank stock and their subsidiary firms in New York. The two principal **Rothschild representatives** in New York, J.P. Morgan Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. were the firms which set up the Jekyll Island Conference at which the Federal Reserve Act was drafted, who directed the subsequent successful campaign to have the plan enacted into law by Congress, and who purchased the controlling amounts of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914. These firms had their principal officers appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Advisory Council in 1914.

Larry Silverstein ate breakfast every morning on top of WTC. None of them showed up on 9/11. Did Israel messenger service Odigo warn them? Silverstein collected billions on the terrorism insurance on WTC he got months before 9/11. The guy who Bush put in charge of the criminal 9/11 investigation, Michael Chertoff, is a dual Israel-US citizen whose mom was Mossad and worked for Mossad airline El Al. His dad was a Talmud scholar. Chertoff let the Dancing Israelis go, let Lucky Larry Silverstein go, then authored the Patriot Act to crush our freedoms.**

#Corbett Report on Dancing Israelis: https://archive.is/KI8ee

From the Corbett Report:

>Their purpose was to “document the event”? But how could they possibly have known what “event” they were documenting at that point, before the second plane strike when those few who even knew about the situation had assumed it to be an accident or pilot error?

>And when did they arrive at the parking lot to “document the event” anyway?

>The FBI reports show how the men gave confused and often conflicting accounts of when and how they learned about what was happening and when they arrived at the parking lot. Oded Ellner even said they had arrived their shortly after 8:00 AM, which would have been 45 minutes before the attacks even began. This is in line with one of the eyewitnesses that had placed their Urban Moving Systems van at the parking lot at 8:00 AM [see page 33 here]. How could they have been in place and ready to “document the event” unless they knew what was about to happen?

>Anyway you cut it, this story is unbelievable. Men with documented connections to Israeli intelligence and working in the United States without appropriate permits were detained after having been caught celebrating the attack on the World Trade Center at a time when no one knew that the WTC strike was an attack. So surely these men are locked behind bars to this day, right? Surely they were transferred to Guantanamo and held without trial for 15 years as part of the “War on Terror,” weren’t they?

>No. They were immediately transferred to federal custody, held for 71 days, and then deported back to Israel. The owner of the “Urban Moving Systems” company that had employed them, Dominik Suter, was investigated by the FBI, too. They concluded that “Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation” and even seized records and computer systems from the company’s offices. When they went back to question him again on September 14th, he had fled back to Israel.

>And what about the dancing Israeli’s pictures themselves? The Justice Department destroyed their copies on January 27, 2014.

>And these intelligence agents on an intelligence mission who were there to “document the event” of 9/11 before anyone knew 9/11 was taking place? Don’t worry, they were just spying on Arab terrorists.

When Ahmed was exposed by the Wall Street Journal as having sent the money to the hijackers, he was forced to ""retire"" by President Pervez Musharraf.

#Mossad ran 9/11 Arab ""hijacker"" terrorist operation

By Wayne Madsen


British intelligence reported in February 2002 that the Israeli Mossad ran the Arab hijacker cells that were later blamed by the U.S. government's 9/11 Commission for carrying out the aerial attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. WMR has received details of the British intelligence report which was suppressed by the government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. A Mossad unit consisting of six Egyptian- and Yemeni-born Jews infiltrated ""Al Qaeda"" cells in Hamburg (the Atta-Mamoun Darkanzali cell), south Florida, and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates in the months before 9/11. The Mossad not only infiltrated cells but began to run them and give them specific orders that would eventually culminate in their being on board four regularly-scheduled flights originating in Boston, Washington Dulles, and Newark, New Jersey on 9/11.

The Mossad infiltration team comprised six Israelis, comprising two cells of three agents, who all received special training at a Mossad base in the Negev Desert in their future control and handling of the ""Al Qaeda"" cells. One Mossad cell traveled to Amsterdam where they submitted to the operational control of the Mossad's Europe Station, which operates from the El Al complex at Schiphol International Airport. The three-man Mossad unit then traveled to Hamburg where it made contact with Mohammed Atta, who believed they were sent by Osama Bin Laden. In fact, they were sent by Ephraim Halevy, the chief of Mossad.

The second three-man Mossad team flew to New York and then to southern Florida where they began to direct the ""Al Qaeda"" cells operating from Hollywood, Miami, Vero Beach, Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach. Israeli ""art students,"" already under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration for casing the offices and homes of federal law enforcement officers, had been living among and conducting surveillance of the activities, including flight school training, of the future Arab ""hijacker"" cells, particularly in Hollywood and Vero Beach.

In August 2001, the first Mossad team flew with Atta and other Hamburg ""Al Qaeda"" members to Boston. Logan International Airport's security was contracted to Huntleigh USA, a firm owned by an Israeli airport security firm closely connected to Mossad â€” International Consultants on Targeted Security â€“ ICTS. ICTS's owners were politically connected to the Likud Party, particularly the Netanyahu faction and then-Jerusalem mayor and future Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. It was Olmert who personally interceded with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to have released from prison five Urban Moving Systems employees, identified by the CIA and FBI agents as Mossad agents. The Israelis were the only suspects arrested anywhere in the United States on 9/11 who were thought to have been involved in the 9/11 attacks.

The two Mossad teams sent regular coded reports on the progress of the 9/11 operation to Tel Aviv via the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. WMR has learned from a Pentagon source that leading Americans tied to the media effort to pin 9/11 on Arab hijackers, Osama Bin Laden, and the Taliban were present in the Israeli embassy on September 10, 2001, to coordinate their media blitz for the subsequent days and weeks following the attacks. It is more than likely that FBI counter-intelligence agents who conduct surveillance of the Israeli embassy have proof on the presence of the Americans present at the embassy on September 10. Some of the Americans are well-known to U.S. cable news television audiences. In mid-August, the Mossad team running the Hamburg cell in Boston reported to Tel Aviv that the final plans for 9/11 were set. The Florida-based Mossad cell reported that the documented ""presence"" of the Arab cell members at Florida flight schools had been established.

The two Mossad ""Al Qaeda"" infiltration and control teams had also helped set up safe houses for the quick exfiltration of Mossad agents from the United States. Last March, WMR reported: ""WMR has learned from two El Al sources who worked for the Israeli airline at New Yorkâ€™s John F. Kennedy airport that on 9/11, hours after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all civilian domestic and international incoming and outgoing flights to and from the United States, a full El Al Boeing 747 took off from JFK bound for Tel Avivâ€™s Ben Gurion International Airport. The two El Al employee sources are not Israeli nationals but legal immigrants from Ecuador who were working in the United States for the airline. The flight departed JFK at 4:11 pm and its departure was, according to the El Al sources, authorized by the direct intervention of the U.S. Department of Defense. U.S. military officials were on the scene at JFK and were personally involved with the airport and air traffic control authorities to clear the flight for take-off. According to the 9/11 Commission report, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta ordered all civilian flights to be grounded at 9:45 am on September 11."" WMR has learned from British intelligence sources that the six-man Mossad team was listed on the El Al flight manifest as El Al employees.

For Mossad, the successful 9/11 terrorist ""false flag"" operation was a success beyond expectations. The Bush administration, backed by the Blair government, attacked and occupied Iraq, deposing Saddam Hussein, and turned up pressure on Israel's other adversaries, including Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Hamas, and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Israelis also saw the U.S., Britain, and the UN begin to crack down on the Lebanese Shi'a diamond business in Democratic Republic of Congo and West Africa, and with it, the logistics support provided by Bout's aviation companies, which resulted in a free hand for Tel Aviv to move in on Lebanese diamond deals in central and west Africa.

Then-Israeli Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu commented on the 9/11 attacks on U.S. television shortly after they occurred. Netanyahu said: ""It is very good!"" It now appears that Netanyahu, in his zeal, blew Mossad's cover as the masterminds of 9/11.",breaking senator ron johnson called gateselites covid event calling inside job new hearings wtc owner larry

1k5x3px,Spanishvisa,💰 What Are the Common Taxes for Clients on the Spanish Non-Lucrative Visa?,"If you're living in Spain on a **Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV)**, it’s important to understand your tax obligations — even though you're not allowed to work in Spain. The NLV allows you to reside in the country without engaging in local economic activity, but **this doesn’t exempt you from paying taxes**. Here’s a breakdown of the key taxes NLV holders should be aware of.

# 🏠 1. Spanish Income Tax (IRPF) – When You're a Tax Resident

If you spend more than **183 days per calendar year in Spain**, you're considered a **tax resident** and must pay taxes on your **worldwide income**, even if you earned it abroad.

* **Tax Rates (2025):**
   * Up to €12,450 → 19%
   * €12,451 – €20,200 → 24%
   * €20,201 – €35,200 → 30%
   * €35,201 – €60,000 → 37%
   * €60,001 – €300,000 → 45%
   * Over €300,000 → 47%

💡 *Even passive income like dividends, pensions, or rental income must be declared.*

# 🏘 2. Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)

Spain charges an annual **Wealth Tax** on residents with worldwide assets over a certain threshold (typically €700,000–€1 million depending on the region).

* Assets include:
   * Real estate
   * Savings and investments
   * Vehicles and valuables

🌍 Non-residents only pay Wealth Tax on assets located in Spain.

# 🏡 3. Non-Resident Income Tax (IRNR) – If You're Not a Tax Resident

If you **spend fewer than 183 days** in Spain and maintain tax residency elsewhere, you're subject to **Non-Resident Income Tax** only on **Spanish-sourced income**, such as:

* Spanish rental income (usually taxed at 19% for EU residents, 24% otherwise)
* Interest from Spanish banks
* Capital gains on Spanish assets

# 📝 4. Modelo 720 – Declaration of Foreign Assets

Tax residents must report **foreign assets over €50,000**, including:

* Foreign bank accounts
* Overseas real estate
* Stocks and pensions abroad

📅 This is an **informative return**, not a tax itself — but failing to file can result in significant penalties.

# 🏛️ 5. Municipal Taxes (IBI)

If you own property in Spain, you’ll likely pay **IBI (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles)** — an annual property tax collected by local councils.

* Based on the **cadastral value** of the property
* Varies by region and municipality

# ⚠️ Summary: Common Taxes for NLV Holders

|Tax Type|Applies To|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Income Tax (IRPF)**|Tax residents|On worldwide income|
|**Wealth Tax**|Tax residents|Threshold varies by region|
|**Non-Resident Income Tax (IRNR)**|Non-residents|On Spanish income only|
|**Modelo 720**|Tax residents|Informative filing on foreign assets|
|**IBI (Property Tax)**|Property owners|Paid annually to local councils|

# ✅ Final Thoughts

While the Non-Lucrative Visa doesn’t allow you to work in Spain, it does come with **clear tax responsibilities** — especially if you become a tax resident. Planning ahead and speaking with a tax advisor can help you stay compliant and avoid surprises.

1k5tfkz,FantasyBookers,"[SFPW 7 - Results] Stars Rise, Bonds Break, and the Riot Draw Nears (June Week 3, 2025)","SFPW rolls into Albuquerque and throws down a night of chaos, precision, and raw emotion. With RoughHouse Riot only two weeks away, Commissioner Dom Dolla shakes the foundations by revealing major entrant numbers for both the men’s and women’s Rumble matches. From tag team tension to championship classics, every match adds weight — and one unforgettable main event might just light the fuse for a fan-favorite reunion.

Catch up on a wild night of declarations, dominance, and destiny — SFPW 7 set the tone, and now the Riot is calling.

Dom Dolla (grinning wide):
“Albuquerque! Welcome back to SmashForce Saturday Night!
We are officially TWO WEEKS away from RoughHouse Riot — and it’s time to reveal FIVE more warriors entering the battlefield!”

(Crowd pops.)

Dom Dolla (pacing with energy):
“The luck of the draw might make or break your night — and trust me, some of these numbers are gonna make life real miserable for a few poor souls.”

(Dom rips open the envelopes one by one.)

⸻

Dom Dolla (smirking):
“Big Daddy Gayle drawing number TWO? Man’s gonna have to go from bell to bell if he wants it bad enough!
Danny Savage at number THIRTY?
Talk about lucky — last man in, fresh legs, fresh fists!”

(Crowd erupts again.)

Dom Dolla (final words, hyping it up):
“At RoughHouse Riot, it doesn’t matter WHEN you enter —
it only matters if you survive!
Let’s get this show started!”

(Dom tosses the mic with a wink as the camera pans across excited fans holding “RoughHouse or Bust!” signs.)

	•	Post-Match Promo: (Camera cuts to the entrance ramp right after the first match — Commissioner Dom Dolla steps out again, holding a second stack of envelopes.)

Dom Dolla (grinning, pacing with energy):
“Y’all thought we were DONE handing out fate?
Nah.
RoughHouse Riot’s about to get even WILDER.”

(Crowd pops.)

Dom Dolla (raising the mic):
“Tonight — we lock in SEVEN more competitors for the Women’s RoughRiot match!

(Dom starts opening envelopes with dramatic flair.)

⸻

	•	Hexia — Entry #5
	•	Lotus FloJo — Entry #24

⸻

Dom Dolla (grinning into the camera):
“Some ladies are hitting the fire early…
Some are swooping in late to pick the bones clean…
Either way — if you want to walk out of RoughHouse Riot, you better bring more than just luck.”

(He gives a quick salute and exits to another loud reaction.)

	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The ring was a whirlwind of chaos from the opening bell — three teams, no tags, all-out war.

Velvet Revolt brought the attitude and raw striking power, with Montana Jackson leveling Mercedes Masca early on with a devastating spinning backfist, while Lotus FloJo tangled up Americana in the corner with wild flurries of kicks. The Bombshells were high-octane chaos, with Rox flying across the ring like a missile, nailing a springboard double dropkick that stunned both Montana and Mercedes.

But the turning point came when Mercedes and Americana found their rhythm. Americana caught Rox mid-air with a tilt-a-whirl slam while Mercedes ducked a wild clothesline from Cherry Bomb and launched her into a spinebuster from Bob McGraw on the outside.

In the ring, Americana recovered just in time to break up a near fall from Lotus on Cherry Bomb — and then, with laser focus, dropped Cherry with her signature Red White & Bruised (spinning lariat) right in the center of the ring.

1… 2… 3!

Winners: Made in America

Americana rose first, fire in her eyes, as Mercedes joined her in the center. Bob McGraw stormed into the ring holding the American flag high as the crowd roared — love ‘em or hate ‘em, the stars and stripes stood tall.

     •	Storyline Impact: Made in America’s victory cements their status as a rising cornerstone of SFPW’s women’s division — not just as symbols, but as serious contenders. By cleanly pinning Cherry Bomb in the middle of a chaotic match, Americana and Mercedes Masca prove that they’re more than red-white-and-blue hype — they can hang with the division’s fastest, flashiest, and fiercest.

Key implications:
	•	Made in America gains credibility. This win wasn’t handed to them. It was earned through grit, chemistry, and power. They now have legitimate momentum heading into RoughHouse Riot, and a tag title opportunity could be within striking distance.
	•	Velvet Revolt walks away without a loss, but without a win. They showcased ferocity and individuality, but their lack of cohesion cost them in the late game. If they want to take the next step as a team, they’ll need to stop fighting like singles stars sharing space.
	•	The Bombshells take a major hit. After talking a big game about shaking up the scene, they’ve now lost back-to-back high-profile matches. Cherry Bomb eating the pin adds tension — and could lead to friction with Rox if the losses keep stacking up.

Bottom line:
Made in America just planted their flag in the division — and now everyone else has to decide whether to salute… or swing.

Match 2:
	•	Match Type: Standard 
	•	Participants: Milagro v Ricky Savage
	•	Winner(s): Milagro 
	•	Who took the pin?: Ricky Savage
     •	Title Match?: No
	•	Star Rating (Game): 4
	•	Pre-Match Promo: [Scene: Backstage at SFPW — the show is in full swing, but in a quieter hallway near the locker rooms, Ava Moreno leans casually against the wall, scrolling on her phone. DJ Moore spots her from down the hall. He straightens his jacket slightly, flashes a quick grin, and strolls over with easy confidence.]

DJ Moore (smirking, voice low and easy):
“Funny…
Ain’t even a match booked tonight, and you’re still the toughest one back here.”

(Ava looks up, one eyebrow raised, amused but interested.)

Ava Moreno (grinning):
“Smooth talker.
Tell me — you lay it on this thick for everyone, or just the lucky few?”

(DJ chuckles, leaning a shoulder against the wall next to her.)

DJ Moore (half-joking, half-serious):
“Only the ones worth it.”

(Ava laughs — a short, genuine laugh — tapping her phone against her palm.)

Ava Moreno (teasing):
“You always this bold, or is it just ‘off days’ that bring it out?”

DJ Moore (grinning wider):
“Depends.
Sometimes you gotta recognize when opportunity’s staring you right in the face.”

(A little beat — Ava leans in just slightly, a playful edge in her voice.)

Ava Moreno:
“Opportunity, huh?
You sure you can keep up with it?”

DJ Moore (locking eyes with her, confident but warm):
“Only one way to find out.”

(They hold eye contact — a subtle, charged moment — both smiling, both clearly intrigued.)

(Ava pushes off the wall, brushing past DJ just lightly enough to make him turn.)

Ava Moreno (glancing back over her shoulder, playful):
“Maybe next show…
you’ll get your shot.”

(DJ watches her walk off, shaking his head with a chuckle, the faintest glimmer of a “challenge accepted” look on his face.)

[Fade out — a new chemistry quietly sparking backstage.]


	•	Post-Match Promo: [Scene: Milagro stands in the center of the ring, breathing heavy but victorious. The crowd is rallying behind him, chanting his name. He rips the mic from the timekeeper’s table, pulling his mask tight and standing tall.]

Milagro (voice strong, filled with passion):
“Tonight… tonight was not just about beating Ricky Savage.”

(He paces slowly, every word deliberate.)

Milagro:
“It was about proving to every single person in that locker room…
every single doubter sitting in the cheap seats…
and every single fool who ever said Milagro was ‘too small,’ ‘too wild,’ ‘too reckless’ —
that heart will always beat hype!”

(Crowd cheers louder — Milagro taps his chest hard, over his heart.)

Milagro (fired up):
“You can throw your biggest hitters at me.
You can try to break me.
You can try to silence me.
But I was born from the struggle.
I was raised by the fight.
I am the dream that refuses to die!”

(He climbs the second rope, pointing out at the crowd, the energy growing with him.)

Milagro (shouting over the noise):
“You will remember my name!
Because Milagro is not a fluke.
Milagro is not a flash.
Milagro is a FORCE.”

(He throws a fist in the air as the crowd roars.)

Milagro (final, powerful words):
“This is only the beginning.
I will not stop until I climb to the top of SmashForce Pro Wrestling.
Because Milagro does not fall…
Milagro RISES!”

(Milagro drops the mic with a heavy thunk, throws both arms up, and soaks in the roar of the crowd — a star ascending before everyone’s eyes.)


	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The match kicks off hot with Ricky Savage trying to impose his strength early—muscling Milagro into the corner and unloading with stiff body blows. But Milagro ducks out, hits the ropes, and flies back with a springboard arm drag that sends Savage sprawling.

Ricky regains control with a brutal spinebuster mid-match, grounding Milagro and pounding away with wild strikes. The crowd boos as Ricky taunts, flexing over Milagro’s prone body.

But Milagro fires back—rolling through a suplex attempt into a jaw-rattling tornado DDT! The crowd roars as Milagro climbs the ropes, measuring the moment. Ricky stumbles to his feet just in time to eat a “Milagro Driver” (diving reverse hurricanrana)!

1… 2… 3!

Milagro picks up the huge win, arms raised high, standing tall over a stunned Ricky Savage. The underdog lucha warrior just scored a major victory over one-half of the brutal Ragin’ Savages—and the crowd lets him know they believe.

Message sent: you may be bigger… but you ain’t faster than a miracle.

     •	Storyline Impact: Milagro’s win over Ricky Savage isn’t just a notch on the record — it’s a statement, a launchpad, and a warning all in one. By defeating one-half of the dangerous Ragin’ Savages in singles competition, Milagro has clearly positioned himself as the next serious contender for the SFPW Intercontinental Championship.

Key Implications:
	•	Next in Line: With this win, Milagro leapfrogs several mid-card names and now sits firmly at the front of the line for an Intercontinental Title shot. His aggressive, high-flying style has turned heads — and now it’s turning the tide of the division.
	•	Momentum Shift: Milagro’s trajectory has quietly become undeniable. From crowd-pleasing underdog to calculated threat, this win shows he’s not just fast — he’s effective. The timing couldn’t be better with RoughHouse Riot looming.
	•	Savage Fallout: Ricky Savage, known for tag brutality, just took a clean L in singles action. That could strain the Ragin’ Savages’ dynamic or force them to reevaluate their grip on dominance. Meanwhile, Bronson Rage — having lost to Brighton Banks — now watches his partner stumble too. Trouble brewing?
	•	IC Division Wake-Up Call: Whoever holds the Intercontinental Title now knows what’s coming — a relentless, aerial wildcard with something to prove. Milagro has never looked more dangerous, and his next match might just be his crowning moment.

In short:
Milagro isn’t just chasing gold anymore.
He’s circling it.
And after tonight — the champ should be nervous.

Match 3:
	•	Match Type: Tag Team
	•	Participants: Tiger Clan v Dust-up Devils 
	•	Winner(s): Dust-Up Devils
	•	Who took the pin?: Tiger Clan(Count Out)
     •	Title Match?: No
	•	Star Rating (Game): 3
	•	Pre-Match Promo: (The camera cuts to a quiet hallway lit by a single overhead bulb. Brighton Banks stands center frame in his “Banks On It” ring gear, sweat still shining on his skin after a workout. There’s no hype music. No fanfare. Just focus.)

Brighton Banks (firm, steady voice):
“RoughHouse Riot.”

(He exhales, staring down the lens.)

Brighton:
“Thirty men walk in — and only one walks out with a shot that changes everything.”

(Pauses, nodding slowly.)

Brighton:
“I’m not the loudest guy in the locker room. I don’t throw chairs, I don’t need mind games, and I don’t hide behind stables or smoke and mirrors.”

(He steps forward slightly, his presence filling the frame.)

Brighton:
“But what I do?
I show up.
I grind.
And when that bell rings…
I deliver.”

(Crowd begins lightly cheering in the background.)

Brighton (smiling faintly):
“They say the Riot chews people up. That it breaks even the toughest down to the bones.
Good.
I don’t want the easy path.”

(He tilts his head, eyes locked on the camera now.)

Brighton:
“Let the others talk about legacy. Let ‘em throw their tantrums and declarations.
I’m walking into that match with one thing in mind—
winning it.”

(Beat.)

Brighton (voice low, confident):
“And if you’re betting on someone to survive the storm?
Banks on it.”

(He nods once and walks off as the SFPW logo flashes onscreen and the crowd roars.)

	•	Post-Match Promo: [Backstage — RoughHouse Riot Hype Zone]
The camera pans across the weight room, where the sound of barbells slamming and locker doors clanking provides a natural soundtrack. In the center of the frame, dressed in matching Varsity Club jackets and game faces, stand Frankie and James — The Varsity Blues.

Frankie (arms crossed, steady):
“Everybody keeps asking us if we’re scared.”
(Pauses, smirks slightly.)
“Scared of the paint. Scared of the masks. Scared of the WarPigs.”

James (laughs sharply):
“Let’s clear that up real quick — we’ve been hit harder on Friday nights under the lights than anything those two clowns can throw.”

Frankie (turning serious):
“They act like chaos makes ‘em untouchable. Like brutality is a strategy.
But chaos doesn’t win games. Execution does.”

(He steps forward, tossing a towel over his shoulder.)

Frankie:
“And we? We execute. On the mat. In the ring. In the clutch.
That’s why we were captains. That’s why we’re walking into RoughHouse Riot like it’s Homecoming.”

James (grinning):
“BLK and Warlord think paint makes ’em scary?
We’ve studied monsters in film class, boys — and guess what? They all fall in the final act.”

Frankie:
“You want to snarl and scream? Go ahead.
Because we’re not backing down, we’re stepping up. And when that bell rings…”

James:
“We’re not fighting in fear.
We’re fighting for the title.
For the team.
For the Varsity.”

(Both men bump fists with focus.)

Frankie (final words, icy calm):
“WarPigs want a riot?
Good.
We brought the pep rally.”

[They walk off side-by-side, the SFPW RoughHouse Riot logo flashing behind them like a stadium jumbotron before the screen cuts to black.]

	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The match opened hot with Tiger Clan’s signature speed and precision—Max Liger and Puma Guerrera flying around the ring with crisp dropkicks and tandem dives to the outside that had the crowd roaring. But the Dustup Devils didn’t flinch. Coyote and Wraith absorbed the storm, biding their time with heavy strikes and brute counters that slowed the match to their pace.

The turning point came late in the bout—Puma went for a springboard crossbody to the outside, but Wraith caught him mid-air and spiked him on the apron with a death valley driver. Max Liger, already dazed, tried to rally, but Coyote cut him off with a brutal boot to the face that sent him tumbling over the barricade.

Wraith rolled back into the ring as the ref began the count. Puma clawed toward the apron, trying to recover, but he was too hurt to make it in time. Max was still out cold in the crowd.

Count: 10. Match over.

The Dustup Devils didn’t celebrate—they just stared down at their fallen prey, stoic and cold as the bell rang.

     •	Storyline Impact: This isn’t the statement win Dustup Devils wanted—but it’s the one they’ll take. Victory by count-out sends a message just as clear: they don’t need to pin you to beat you. They just need to hurt you bad enough you can’t get up.

For Tiger Clan, this is a blow to their tag team momentum. The chemistry is still there—but this marks their second straight match where things slipped through the cracks. As the Road to RoughHouse Riot gets bloodier, Tiger Clan needs to rally fast… or risk becoming prey.

Meanwhile, the Dustup Devils just proved they can outlast any storm. Now, they’re looking to bring a dust storm of their own to the Riot.

Match 4:
	•	Match Type: Triple Threat
	•	Participants: Becca Carter v Rachel Valentine v Julia Sky
	•	Winner(s): Rachel Valentine 
	•	Who took the pin?: Becca Carter
     •	Title Match?: No
	•	Star Rating (Game): 4.5
	•	Pre-Match Promo: [Dark Corridor — Static-Cut Promo Package]
The screen buzzes to life in monochrome red. A single flickering lightbulb swings above. We hear heavy, almost animalistic breathing before BLK steps into frame — facepaint smeared, blood crusted at the corners of his mouth. Warlord paces behind him, dragging a length of rusted chain across the floor.

BLK (voice low, guttural):
“You ever hear pigs scream, boys?”

(Pauses. Smiles slowly.)

BLK:
“It ain’t pretty. It ain’t polished.
It’s wild. It’s real.
It’s what happens right before the slaughter.”

(Warlord steps forward now, head tilted, staring dead into the lens.)

Warlord (raspy):
“You wear your school colors like armor.
We wear our scars like sermons.”

BLK:
“Frankie. James. Varsity Blues.”
(Scoffs.)
“All that training. All those drills.
Still won’t teach you how to breathe through broken ribs.”

(Warlord slams the chain to the ground — CLANG.)

Warlord (growling):
“You talk about execution?
We perfected it in basements, in alleys, in cages.
You practiced it in pep rallies.”

BLK (stepping close, the camera now shaking slightly):
“This Saturday, you ain’t walking into a match.
You’re walking into an ambush.”

(He licks his lips slowly.)

BLK:
“We don’t wrestle.
We rupture.”

Warlord (final words, low and cold):
“RoughHouse Riot isn’t your Homecoming…
It’s your funeral.”

(They both stare into the lens in total silence, then the screen cuts out with a single, jarring squeal — like microphone feedback or something much more animalistic.)

[Static. Fade to black. WAR IS COMING.]

	•	Post-Match Promo: [SFPW RoughHouse Riot – Main Event Hype Promo | Tokyo Thunder]
Location: Rooftop gym at dusk, skyline behind him. Tokyo Thunder is training—repetitive strikes against a leather bag. His breathing is calm, methodical. The camera closes in as he finally stops, sweat dripping from his brow. He turns to face it.

Tokyo Thunder (quiet but sharp):
“Qu’Ran Cook.
The SmashForce World Heavyweight Champion.
A man forged in fire and war.”

(Pauses. Rolls his shoulders. Stares down the lens.)

“But you haven’t faced me.
Not like this.
Not when it matters most.”

(He walks toward the camera, letting the SFPW skyline fill the backdrop.)

“I don’t walk into this main event to be another notch on your belt.
I walk in as the final challenge.
The wall you can’t climb.
The storm you can’t silence.”

(He breathes in deep — his tone rising slightly.)

“Because this is not just my opportunity.
これは、すべての犠牲の証明です。
(‘This is the proof of every sacrifice I’ve made.’)

これは、日本の魂です。
(‘This is the soul of Japan.’)

これは、雷の復讐です。
(‘This is the vengeance of thunder.’)”

(He steps closer now, voice like steel.)

“Qu’Ran —
You’ve been dominant. Ruthless. A true champion.
But at RoughHouse Riot…
You’re not standing across from just another contender.
You’re standing across from Tokyo Thunder.
The man they underestimated.
The name they didn’t expect.
The end you didn’t see coming.”

(He raises one hand and slowly clenches it into a fist.)

“I am honor.
I am pain.
I am precision.”

Tokyo Thunder (final line, in Japanese):
“世界に雷を落とす時が来た。
(‘It’s time to drop thunder on the world.’)”

(He bows to the camera — then turns and begins striking the heavy bag again as the shot fades to black, the rumble of distant thunder layered beneath his hits.)

	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The match starts with an immediate spark, each woman showcasing her signature striking prowess. Rachel keeps a calculated pace, dissecting her opponents with precision. Becca Carter brings grit and agility, while Julia Sky explodes with emotion and heart, determined to prove she belongs.

Midway through the match, Becca catches Julia with a spinning heel kick, nearly securing a three-count before Rachel breaks it up with a brutal knee strike to Becca’s jaw. All three women clash in a wild sequence — Julia stuns Rachel with a rope-assisted bulldog, Becca flies in with a diving clothesline, and Rachel counters mid-air with a picture-perfect dropkick that levels both opponents.

As the crowd roars, Julia tries to rally with a fiery comeback, lighting up Rachel with quick strikes — until Rachel rolls through a sunset flip, yanks Julia into a snap DDT, and sends her crashing outside the ring.

Becca rises slowly — dazed but determined. She charges, but Rachel sidesteps, hits a spinning backfist to stun her, and hoists her up into the “Final Verdict” (double-knee facebuster). Becca hits the mat hard.

Rachel covers —
1… 2… 3!

Rachel Valentine rises with icy focus, barely celebrating. She didn’t just win — she calculated this victory. And she made sure Becca took the fall.

Winner: Rachel Valentine

     •	Storyline Impact: Rachel Valentine’s victory in this triple threat match sends a clear, cold message to the women’s division heading into RoughHouse Riot: discipline beats desperation.

Here’s how this shakes up the landscape:

Rachel Valentine: Precision Ascent
	•	This win solidifies Rachel’s status as a top-tier competitor in the women’s division, and potentially inches her closer to a world title opportunity.
	•	By pinning Becca — someone ranked higher — Rachel leapfrogs the line with execution, not noise.
	•	Her calm, calculated approach continues to separate her from the flashier or more emotional stars. She’s not here for chaos. She’s here for gold.

Becca Carter: Confidence Rattled
	•	Becca came in with momentum and ranking advantage, but getting pinned in the center of the ring is a critical blow.
	•	The respectful striker may need to reevaluate her game plan heading into RoughHouse Riot. Is her respectful approach too measured in a division that’s getting nastier by the week?
	•	This could lead to a potential rivalry with Rachel — especially if Becca believes the win was stolen with tactical timing more than true dominance.

Julia Sky: On the Rise
	•	Julia wasn’t pinned — and she hung in against two ranked veterans. That protects her status and gives her a subtle boost.
	•	The crowd continues to rally behind her perseverance, and this performance might convince fans (and management) that Julia’s ready for a spotlight singles match sooner than expected.

Big Picture:

Rachel didn’t just win — she redefined the rules of engagement. While others brawl for glory, she plans for it.
As the Riot nears, Rachel Valentine is no longer the quiet tactician on the edge of the radar —
she’s a silent threat moving straight toward the center.

Match 5:
	•	Match Type: Tag Team
	•	Participants: Los Magos v Grimm + Anderson
	•	Winner(s): Grimm + Anderson 
	•	Who took the pin?: Los Magos
     •	Title Match?: No
	•	Star Rating (Game): 4
	•	Pre-Match Promo: (Camera opens on Xander Grimm and Austin Anderson taping up in the locker room. The atmosphere is already tense — their body language says it all. Austin paces, fire in his eyes. Xander stands in place, calm but visibly annoyed.)

Austin Anderson (snapping):
“You think you’re the leader out there just ’cause you trained longer? Just ’cause you walk like some silent samurai? Get over yourself, Grimm. This isn’t a dojo — it’s SmashForce.”

Xander Grimm (coldly):
“No one said I’m the leader, Anderson. But if we’re stepping in that ring together, I expect discipline. Not tantrums. I fight to win — not to stroke my ego.”

(Austin laughs sarcastically, throwing his wrist tape to the floor.)

Austin Anderson:
“You wanna talk about ego? You act like you’ve got wrestling coded into your DNA. Like you’re above it all. Well tonight, partner, try not to stare at your reflection in the ropes while I’m out there doing the heavy lifting.”

Xander Grimm (stepping up, unflinching):
“Then don’t get in my way.”

(They’re nose to nose, the tension thick — fists clenched — until a mocking voice cuts in off-camera.)

El Mago Sr. (off-screen, taunting):
“Oooh… trouble in paradise?”

(Camera pans to Los Magos — El Mago Sr. and El Mago Jr. — walking past with cocky smirks and smug confidence.)

El Mago Jr. (chuckling):
“If you two clowns can’t even get along backstage… how do you expect to survive against actual teams out there?”

El Mago Sr.:
“Try not to embarrass yourselves out there, amigos. We’ve already got the ratings covered tonight.”

(They laugh and walk off, leaving Austin and Xander both fuming — but now, their anger seems redirected.)

Austin Anderson (gritting his teeth, finally looking at Xander):
“Let’s shut their mouths. Then we can settle ours.”

Xander Grimm (nodding once):
“Agreed.”

(Camera fades as they walk toward gorilla — fire in their veins, fists ready. The storm is coming.)


	•	Post-Match Promo: [The screen flickers to static before a sleek, cold visual fades in. Dim spotlights cut across a blacked-out training facility. Each hit of the slow, pulsating beat matches the sound of boots echoing on concrete.]

A voice begins — smooth, confident, clipped with precision.

Paragon Jay Pierce (voiceover):
“They say SFPW is the land of killers…
of monsters…
of chaos.”

[A shot of Jay Pierce’s intense eyes. He’s standing in front of a mirror, slowly wrapping his wrists with calculated precision.]

Jay:
“Well, consider me the correction.”

[Clips flash quickly: him hitting clean, clinical strikes on punching pads. A textbook suplex in a dim-lit ring. A sparring partner tapping out furiously to a triangle hold.]

Jay (coldly):
“I don’t scream. I don’t bleed for the crowd.
I don’t need a gimmick, a faction, or a mask.”

[He stands now in a locker room hallway, dressed in sharp training gear with one arm casually resting on his hip. He looks directly into the camera.]

Jay:
“I am The Paragon—the standard by which this roster will be measured.”

(Beat.)

Jay:
“And starting next week…
they’re all going to fail.”

[He smirks, but there’s no warmth to it.]

Jay (leaning forward slightly):
“You don’t need to like me.
You just need to accept what’s coming.”

[Quick flashes: the Intercontinental Title glimmering under a spotlight… a slow shot of Jay wiping his hands and walking away from a downed opponent… the word “PARAGON” slamming across the screen in bold white.]

Jay (final words):
“Perfection isn’t an aspiration.
It’s a birthright.”

[The screen goes black. A final line pulses onscreen:]

“NEXT WEEK: PARAGON JAY PIERCE ARRIVES.”
“THE ERA OF EXCUSES ENDS.”

[SFPW Logo pulses into frame. Fade out.]
	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: This one was chaos wrapped in teamwork issues.

From the start, Anderson and Grimm struggled to stay on the same page. Every blind tag between them came with side-eyes and clipped remarks, the tension brewing louder than the crowd. Anderson refused to tag out early, throwing hands like he had something to prove, while Grimm paced the apron like a caged animal.

But when the bell rang, skill took over.

Grimm finally tagged in after Anderson narrowly dodged a double team, and the Cruiserweight powerhouse exploded — darting in with sharp knees, precision strikes, and a brutal combo that left El Mago Jr. reeling. Anderson demanded a tag back, and Grimm slapped his chest with force, tagging out with venom in his glare.

Anderson hit the ring like a shotgun blast — elbowing Sr. off the apron, dodging Jr.’s lariat, and nailing a running knee to the jaw. He picked Jr. up for a suplex, but Grimm tagged himself in mid-move.

Anderson yelled. Grimm didn’t answer.

Grimm stalked Jr., spun him, and hit “The Grimm Ending” (Ripcord V-Trigger into German Suplex). Clean, vicious, final.

1… 2… 3.

Winners: Xander Grimm & Austin Anderson

Anderson stood outside the ring, staring in disbelief as Grimm took the pin — stealing the spotlight at the last second.

No post-match celebration. No handshake. Just two men standing tall in the same ring… but worlds apart.

The win? Undeniable.
The partnership? Ready to crack.

     •	Storyline Impact: This match was less about teamwork and more about territory — and both Austin Anderson and Xander Grimm just staked a claim.

Key Developments:
	•	Rising Tensions, Rising Stakes:
Anderson and Grimm won, but the tension between them only got worse. Every glare, every blind tag, every refusal to share credit signals a potential implosion on the horizon. They may be dominant, but they’re not united — and that’s dangerous for everyone… including each other.
	•	Power Hierarchy Clash:
Anderson, ranked higher, sees himself as the natural standout. Grimm, with the higher power ranking and a chip on his shoulder, isn’t playing second fiddle. This clash of pride vs. discipline is brewing into a full-on power struggle — one that could steal the spotlight at RoughHouse Riot.
	•	Los Magos Exposed:
While respected veterans, Los Magos looked outclassed. This loss might push them into desperation mode or force a reinvention — especially as younger, faster teams continue to surge past them.

Bigger Picture:

The uneasy alliance between Grimm and Anderson is reaching its limit. They proved they can win despite each other — but that might not be enough moving forward. One wants glory. The other wants control. And when RoughHouse Riot rolls around, it’s not a question of if they explode…

…it’s who throws the first punch.

Match 6:

Dom Dolla (grinning big):
“Alright, alright — before we light up the main event tonight, we’re not done shaping destiny.”

(Crowd buzzing in the background.)

Dom Dolla (raising the mic):
“Six more warriors — six more dreams about to get a whole lot harder… or maybe a whole lot easier.”

(He starts tearing open the envelopes.)

(The screen flashes with the RoughHouse Riot logo and fades out as the crowd cheers.)


	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The crowd in Albuquerque is on its feet before the bell even rings — chanting “TEA-BAG-GERS!” as the echoes of history swirl through the arena. Two former tag champs. Two brothers in arms. Now, bitter rivals for gold.

The match is a masterclass in pacing and storytelling. Kick Lethal starts fast, keeping the tempo high with dazzling strikes, rope-running reversals, and near-falls off rolling lariats and springboard kicks. Henry Alexander slows things down, targeting the knees with pinpoint dropkicks and old-school grappling. He dissects Kick’s legs to neutralize the high-flying offense.

Midway through, the pace picks up again — a furious back-and-forth sees Kick land the Roundhouse Reckoning, but Henry kicks out at 2.9. Kick doesn’t hesitate — he pulls Henry up for the Killshot Driver — but Henry twists mid-air into a British Clutch Suplex right into the turnbuckles.

They’re both down.

The final minute is sheer drama.

Kick Lethal reverses The Gentleman’s Guillotine, rolls through, and goes for a flash cradle — 1… 2… no! Henry kicks out, pops to his feet, and nails the Empire Elbow dead center of the ring.

He doesn’t go for the cover.

Instead, he helps Kick Lethal to his knees — makes eye contact — and hits one final, thunderous Regal Crown Driver.

1… 2… 3.

Winner & Still Champion: Henry Alexander

After the bell, the arena goes silent.

Henry sits up first. Kick is flat on the mat, gasping, eyes fluttering. Henry doesn’t gloat. He doesn’t celebrate.

He helps Kick Lethal to his feet.

There’s a long pause…

Then they hug.

The crowd explodes — “TEA-BAG-GERS! TEA-BAG-GERS!” thunders through the arena. Henry grabs Kick’s hand and raises it high, nodding with quiet respect. Kick mouths “Thank you” and pats the title on Henry’s shoulder before backing out of the ring to give him the spotlight.

No betrayal. No cheap shots.

Just mutual respect, old wounds starting to heal, and the tease of something beloved returning.

This wasn’t just a championship defense.
It was a love letter to legacy.

     •	Storyline Impact: This wasn’t just a title match — it was a turning point in SFPW’s emotional landscape.

For Henry Alexander:
	•	The successful defense further cements his status as one of the most technically gifted and emotionally complex champions in the company. He didn’t just retain — he proved he could put on a classic without resorting to arrogance or betrayal.
	•	This match subtly rewrites his narrative. Henry isn’t just “The British Ace” anymore — he’s now seen as a champion with depth, respect, and unfinished emotional ties that resonate with fans.
	•	The sportsmanship shown post-match softens his heelish edge and teases a slow-burn face turn — or at least a moral complexity that deepens his character ahead of RoughHouse Riot.

For Kick Lethal:
	•	Though he lost, Kick walks out with elevated stock. This was his first world-class performance since the breakup of The Teabaggers, and he proved he could hang on his own. He’s no longer a forgotten tag guy — he’s a solo threat.
	•	His loss wasn’t a failure. It was a reconciliation. And now that the wounds are healing, the crowd is clearly ready for something more.
	•	The fan chants of “TEA-BAGGERS!” show there’s serious desire to see the tag team reborn — or at least revisit the bond between them.

Bigger Picture:
	•	This match sets the stage for a potential Teabaggers reunion, whether temporary or long-term. The crowd response gives SFPW a goldmine of fan investment to explore.
	•	Alternatively, it can also lead to a compelling slow-burn will-they-won’t-they tag story — maybe they reunite for a tag run… or maybe one of them eventually betrays the moment for ambition.
	•	And with Henry now having beaten his past… his future challengers are on notice. A reinvigorated Kick, a rising Joe Osborn, or an incoming wildcard from RoughHouse Riot — the Cruiserweight Division is heating up.

In short:
This wasn’t an ending — it was a reconciliation, a beginning, and a spark. The Teabaggers’ shadow now looms large over SFPW once again… and the whole division is better for it.

1ijsolm,TickerTalkByLiam,Small cap going big - why you dont want to miss this:,"$ONEI At first, I couldn’t believe a small-cap stock like ONEI was actually partnered with Microsoft. But after digging deeper, I found the Enterprise Teams partnership confirmation. Then, it got even crazier…



✅ Multi-Billion Dollar Partners: Genesys, Five9, NICE, Cisco, and more.



✅ NYSE Uplisting in Progress:

📌 S-1 Form Filed: Dec 20, 2024

📌 S-1 Amendment: Jan 15, 2025 (meaning NYSE responded positively - otherwise, it would’ve been rejected).



Then the biggest find - a Reddit leak on an upcoming Xbox partnership. At first, I was skeptical, but after some research… IT MAKES SENSE.



✅ ONEI is already partnered with Microsoft Teams - why wouldn’t they expand into Xbox?

✅ Using VPN, I found data on Xbox’s website hinting at a new feature launch.

✅ AI & real-time multilingual voice tech would be a game-changer in live gaming.



Then today, BOOM - more Microsoft buyout buzz on OneMeta. With the AI wave (DeepSeek, AI runners) skyrocketing, this could be the perfect timing for an acquisition.



💥 PR Incoming: 

1️⃣ NYSE Uplisting Confirmation

2️⃣ Microsoft/Xbox Partnership Rumors Unfolding



I’m adding 27K shares - let’s see how this plays out. Wish me luck! 🤌🔥

1ij6acr,TickerTalkByLiam,$ONEI  - MICROSOFT BUYOUT LOADING?! 🤯🔥,"Yo… something’s up. Microsoft just might be scooping up OneMeta for their next big AI move. Y’all remember when they dropped $19.7B on Nuance $NUANU? Now, Verbum AI is out here flexing real-time multilingual AI and suddenly there’s chatter about $MSFT making moves?! 👀

🔎 Connect the dots, don’t be late:  
📌 NYSE Uplist LOADING – ONEI leveling up, institutions incoming.  
📌 Gaming + AI + Cloud?? – Xbox, Azure, Teams... it ALL fits.  
📌 MSFT NEEDS AI DOMINANCE – Google $GOOG $GOOGL & Amazon $AMZN ain’t waiting.  
📌 Enterprise AI EXPLODING – ONEI already w/ Cisco $CSCO, Genesys, Five9, $NICE.  
📌 Stock ACCUMULATING – Volume creeping, shorts STUCK.

  
if this rumor is even HALF true, ONEI ain't staying under $1.

You waiting for CNBC to tell you? Or you loading before it’s too late? 🚀🔥

1ihrpvo,TickerTalkByLiam,🚨ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR SECOND CHANCE TO GET RICH?🚨,"Yo, listen up! While everyone’s hyping up NVDA and TSLA, let’s get real for a minute: big companies only give you a measly 300% growth at best. Remember, if you’d bought NVDA when it was a secret, you’d be laughing all the way to the bank - just like early Apple or Louis Vuitton. And hey, folks who snagged BTC at $200? They’re now swimming in profits!

Today’s spotlight: ONEI.

Right now, ONEI is dipping hard, and that’s your moment. This is the classic “buy and forget” opportunity ------>>> like those secret small-caps that exploded once nobody cared. We’re not chasing the hype of overblown giants; we’re talking about strong, fundamentally-backed stocks that could see 10,000% growth.

💥 Why settle for 100% or 300% gains when ONEI might just be your ticket to life-changing wealth?Invest $100 in ONEI today, and who knows what the future holds? This is the second chance you’ve been waiting for - a chance to jump in while the price is down and ride the wave when it rockets back up!

We’re on a mission:  
👉 20 million insights a day - we hit 10 million before, now let’s double it!  
👉 5 posts on ONEI and 5 on MYNZ daily - we’re not about the old GME/AMC hype, we’re in the realm of true potential.  


If you’ve ever dreamed of that “buy the dip” moment that could change your life, ONEI is calling your name!

🔥 Don’t sleep on this - FOMO is real, and opportunities like this don’t come knocking twice! 🔥

1aonbsv,wallstreetbetsGER,"Meint ihr, dass ist nur so ein AMY ding, oder würde es auch in der heutigen Zeit für Deutschland gelten? Sprich, dass man ein Auge auf die Unternehmen werfen sollte, wo reiche weiße Mädchen rein investieren würden (sich für interessieren könnte)?","I talked about the idea [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9mvabs/z/e7htx2q), and it's a simple one, but potentially lucrative. All that needs to be done is identify public companies with major product lines enjoyed particularly by basic white girls and equal weight them. Intuitively it makes sense; these are customers with money and the ability to set cultural trends. Here is the American white girl index as I currently have it:

* AAPL
* DECK
* DIS
* EL
* FB
* LB
* LULU
* NKE
* SBUX
* UAA
* ULTA
* VFC

If we add foreign stocks, we can include these:

* ADDYY
* DEO
* LRLCY
* LVMUY

I don't remember the rest of what we came up with, but regardless, backtest and behold. White girls crush the market.

EDIT: I'm back in this thread, and I agree about several of the proposed additions, most notably TIF. A lot of you are asking why I left out SNAP, though. I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways. That said, if any of you put some money into a scheme like this, feel free to add or subtract whatever you want. I am powerless to stop you.

EDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:

* ETSY
* FIZZ
* GOOS
* NFLX
* SNAP
* TGT
* TIF

I personally would decline to add a couple of those due either to very recent IPOs or a lack of history of profitability, but they do fit the stereotypes.",meint ihr dass ist nur ein amy ding oder wrde es auch der heutigen zeit fr deutschland gelten sprich dass man ein auge auf die unternehmen werfen sollte wo reiche weie mdchen rein investieren wrden sich fr interessieren knnte,talked idea herehttpswwwredditcomrinvestingcommentsmvabszehtxq simple one potentially lucrative needs done identify public companies major product lines enjoyed particularly basic white girls equal weight intuitively makes sense customers money ability set cultural trends american white girl index currently aapl deck dis el fb lb lulu nke sbux uaa ulta vfc add foreign stocks include addyy deo lrlcy lvmuy dont remember rest came regardless backtest behold white girls crush market edit im back thread agree several proposed additions notably tif lot asking left snap though simply forgot even didnt public short time would screw decent backtest would probably include company history positive eps anyways said put money scheme like feel free add subtract whatever want powerless stop edit accordance community consensus go ahead add etsy fizz goos nflx snap tgt tif personally would decline add couple due either recent ipos lack history profitability fit stereotypes,0.5,Aktienvorschlag,['LRLCY'],negative,0.98739004,negative,0.5245458483695984

1k67cj6,repweidiansneakers,"[MOD POST] Finding, Writing, and Sharing High-Quality Reviews","Hi all,

This post will become the latest automoderator post in the group, [r/RepWeidianSneakers](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepWeidianSneakers/). It will aim to help community members either identify high-quality reviews to use when forming their opinions OR write their own high-quality reviews to give back to the community. This post will outline the key components of a high-quality review, and community members can easily reference this post when navigating the rep world, as certain communities can be littered with paid promotional ads from ""reviewers,"" which can lead to [newer members being led astray](https://imgur.com/a/yVco7FM).

This group was built upon the philosophy of doing your own research in order to form educated opinions. Thinking back to middle school, finding reputable sources is key in this process. Let's go over how to spot reliable content and how to produce reliable content yourself.

# Bare Minimum:

1. **Include Anything Needed to Remake the Purchase from Scratch:**

Imagine you are brand new to the rep world. What information would you need in order to remake the purchase you are reviewing?

a. Seller Name and Contact Information (W2C Link, WeChat, or WhatsApp)

b. Batch Name

c. Silhouette Name

d. Price Paid

e. Payment Method Used

2. **In-Hand Pictures**

You purchased the product and have it in your hands. Take some pictures! Reviews are not the time to use QC pictures, stock pictures, or no pictures at all. In my experience, reviews without pictures are often seller-alt accounts or buyers posting only because the seller asked them to.

And look, I get it. Not everyone has the time to write detailed posts for every single post. When he's not giving us solid batch vs batch comparisons, group member [Chyllian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chyllian/) gives us some crisp in-hand pictures with most of the relevant information listed above, like he does here in[ his in-hand post of GX Batch AJ4 F&F Mochas](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1eqi1ch/inhand_aj4_travis_scott_ff_mocha_450260_direct/).

# Key Components of a High-Quality Review:

1. **What Led You to Purchase This Batch In Particular? How Does Your Purchase Compare to Other Batches On The Market?**

Remember, mentioning the batch name is in the Bare Minimum section, so we've already lost the majority of reviews from the paid ""reviewers."" This is of course not counting when they do list a batch name and it either is a non-existent batch or is not actually what they received.

Here is your chance to take people through your thought process. Don't simply say ""message this seller and use my discount code: SoldMySoulForShoes"" - walk the readers through it. ""I purchased Y Batch because of its overall accuracy and price point/advantages over Z Batch including XYZ/it was on sale even though it is not a top batch."" Or, you can simply compare and contrast pros and cons of your purchase versus other batches on the market.

*Example:* Check out group member [content\_baby\_6763](https://www.reddit.com/user/content_baby_6763/)'s review on [DGC AJ3 AMMs here](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1evkymi/in_handon_foot_jordan_3_a_ma_mani%C3%A9re_violet_ore/). They go over the current options on the market and why they made the selection that they did. Add in the well-formatted title and detailed logistical review, and it's a great review.

2. **Title Contains Key Terms to Make the Post Searchable**

What good is your review if nobody can find it? Make sure your title contains the relevant details that someone using the search bar would need to use to find your post. In order of importance, this includes Batch Name, Silhouette, Price, and Seller Name. An example of a strong title would be \[REVIEW\] $92 LJR Batch TS1 Fragments from TMF.

*Example:* [This review](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1e8fscw/review_130_tg_batch_onitsuka_tiger_tokuten_from/) from group member [Shatterrrrrr](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shatterrrrrr/) does this excellently, outlines his overall purchasing process, and even touches on flaws on his purchase. Even as a first time post, this review blows many others out of the water.

# Cherries on Top

1. Formatting!

How you format a review can go a long way. Don't just write a block of text as that can be difficult to follow. Reddit offers different formatting options like **bold**, *italics*, headings, titles. Use these to your advantage.

*Example:* Check out rep veteran [Rep-Hippie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rep-Hippie/)'s [on-foot review](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1ehj8bd/rfa_white_thunder_on_foot_review/), where he uses headings to separate his review into different sections, making it easy for the reader to either follow completely or quickly find specific sections.

2. Linking Relevant Posts or Resources

This is a personal favorite of mine. Rather than simply stating an opinion, let people see it with their own eyes. Linking batch comparison posts, replica vs retail posts, stock images, or even other reviews in your post can help show others you've done your research. It also expedites the research process for any readers. Again, Rep-Hippie's review linked above does this excellently.

3. Going Above and Beyond With Details

This is going to be the hardest point to hit unless you really, really put in the work in terms of knowing the product you purchased. The reviews that I personally weigh most are those that hit all of the points above *and* display a great depth of knowledge. rep veteran [previous\_muffin\_6199](https://www.reddit.com/user/previous_muffin_6199/) constantly puts on masterclasses of this, but I'll like just one example [here of his review on Updated LJR AJ4 Military Blues](https://www.reddit.com/r/repweidiansneakers/comments/1enyg6s/updated_ljr_ln4_reviewrep_vs_retail_reveal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). In a singular post, you get a replica vs retail comparison, a batch vs batch comparison, tips on how to legit check (from batch characteristics to size tag details), to tips on how to make sure you aren't unintentionally or intentionally bait and switched. In my opinion, this is where everyone should try to get, but it takes time, effort, and practice.

# Key Components NOT Included

Let me be clear - receiving a pair discounted or at no cost does not disqualify anyone from writing a helpful, truthful review. Sure, readers should be more wary when they see a review for a product that was in some way subsidized. *However*, it takes effort and some knowledge to *actually* write a review, and not just be a seller-servant advertising account. [Without effort, you end up advertising upmarked budget batches, or becoming the people lying in the comments under each other's posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakerreps/comments/1bjp0mu/comment/kvtkh57/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Utilizing the components listed above, you should be able to distinguish between anyone who is ""reviewing"" simply for the sake of receiving free pairs of shoes, and those who are reviewing in order to help the community. Don't forget that *anyone* can become a ""reviewer,"" and it's ultimately up to you to decide what kind of reviewer you'd like to be. As Uncle Ben once said...

1k67285,asoiaf,(Spoilers Extended) Aemond should have looked to Daeron,"Instead of trying to conscript Helaena, Aemond should look to Daeron. 

**Background:**

When Aemond flies to Dragonstone he sees that Rhaenyra has increased the amount of dragonriders *and* that they (Hugh, Ulf, Addam) all ride large, older dragons. None the size of Vhagar, but Vermithor especially is a big threat. Combined with Silverwing, and Seasmoke— the stakes have drastically increased. 

He shows that he knows this by quickly retreating and trying to get Helaena to ride Dreamfyre into battle upon returning to KL. She refuses, says she won’t burn people, that he cannot make her. 

**Why does she refuse?**

While Helaena’s refusal to burn people alive is understandable, it’s clear that she doesn’t trust Aemond anymore. Presumably because both Helaena and Alicent suspect/know, Aegon has been burned beyond recovery (for now) by Aemond. How can she have any security that Aemond wouldn’t do that to her? The very fact he did it to Aegon (when Sunfyre was their only other dragon immediately ready for war) is basically Aemond intentionally friendly firing his brother when they are in dire straights. 

Daeron is the only remaining family member both with a dragon *and* knightly training that could serve as a replacement for Dreamfyre. While Tessarion isn’t as big as Dreamfyre— there aren’t any other options. 

In S2E3:

> Aegon: Do you have any better suggestions, Lord Jasper?

> Jasper: Your lord uncle Ormund marches from Oldtown at the head of a great host, Your Grace. **And your brother Daeron’s dragon nears fighting age.** Call on them to suppress the Riverlands.

> Tyland: Alas, they are months away.

For some reason this is set aside/put on the back burner. I’m not sure why Oldtown is “months away” even if Daeron flies with the army. 


**Repeating your mistakes and making them worse:**

Helaena refuses to ride Dreamfyre into battle, so now Aemond should have even better reason to go to Daeron. Yet, he seeks out Helaena *again* to try and persuade/force her. 

> Helaena: And if I refuse? Will you burn me as you did Aegon

> Aemond: that is a lie… (Helaena then predicts Aegon being king again and Aemond’s death) 

> Aemond: I could have have you killed 

> Helaena: it wouldn’t change anything. 

Death threats do not exactly instill trust. Helaena offered Aemond the opportunity to tell her no, that he would never do that. Whether it was for reasons of family, duty, or honor. But he didn’t. 

I remember speculating excitedly on discord when the show was announced (but Daeron was never cast) that this was indication Helaena (who gets little characterization in F&B) would take on a more prominent role. But instead, we have an awkward in between. Even now HBO had not included Tessarion on their Dragon Casting Sheet, and Dreamfyre has been added and removed several times until (currently) she has a stock dragon cut out image. 

This reads like a series of half measures.  

**Daeron’s Trajectory in HOTD:**

Overall, I’m puzzled and admittedly frustrated at the continued dancing around of the characters. 

Daeron is entirely absent in S1, the only possible mention of Tessarion coming indirectly from daemon saying that they have “three adult dragons” before totaling the count to “four dragons to our thirteen” (which reads very confusingly/like the writers are trying to account for possibly not including Daeron/Tessarion)

In S2 he’s brought up very reasonably in Ep3, but at Orwyle’s suggestion they combine armies the Council laughs and does not revisit the subject for 5 more episodes. 

By the time E8 rolls around, the focus is on getting Helaena to fight on Dreamfyre. For some reason Daeron doesn’t come to mind despite Tessarion being newly of fighting age and Daeron a knight. Helaena has none of his martial training and is said to not even ride Dreamfyre. It beggars belief that Aemond keeps pushing for her to join him in the Riverlands especially after she expresses her suspicions that he might burn her. 

His reaction to her fears: “I could have you killed.” Does not instill loyalty or trust. 

**Concluding Thoughts**: 

Aemond’s reaction to Helaena’s fear/suspicions, is to threaten her with death. Exactly why Daeron is the better option. He will have a blank slate view of his brother, Aemond. And that’s the best Aemond can hope for right now. 

As it stands, this reads like a series of half measures. A continual 2 steps forward, 1 step back, without a clear path forward in sight.

Just left Costco and everything is more expensive than my last visit 6 weeks ago. We stock up every 6 weeks or so. Things that were $9 are now $11 and avocados were $5 more for 5 of them. Nuts are $1 more depending on what ones you buy. We literally left the avocados in the store and said fuck it.

The only thing cheaper or the same is fish for whatever reason. Fish the same, shrimp cheaper. 

Our leader is failing at the main thing we need. And don’t tell me gas is less, F u and your $0.10 cents less per gallon, that adds up to ass.

1k6618o,EverHint,"[Markets, etc in a Nutshell] April 23, 2025, Mid Day","# Market Analysis for April 23, 2025

Hello r/EverHint! As your stock market and financial analyst, I’m here to provide a detailed yet approachable analysis of today’s markets. It’s April 23, 2025, 11:05 AM PDT, and I’ve reviewed 10 days of historical data, today’s current market data, breaking news headlines from the last 12 hours, and today’s 30-year fixed mortgage rate. Using the provided JSON structure as a guide, I’ll cover all key categories—currencies, bonds, commodities, cryptocurrencies, indices, and futures—while keeping the tone neutral with a touch of friendliness. Let’s get started!

---

## Currencies: A Stronger Dollar Takes Center Stage

In the currency markets, the **EUR/USD** pair (EURUSD=X) is a critical gauge of the US dollar’s strength against the euro. Over the past 10 days, historical data shows a downward trend, signaling a strengthening dollar. As of now, EUR/USD is trading at 1.1418, down 0.81% from yesterday. This aligns with chatter on X indicating a rising **US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB)**, which is putting downward pressure on the euro. Other pairs like **GBP/USD** (GBPUSD=X) and **AUD/USD** (AUDUSD=X) may also be feeling this dollar strength, though specific data for these isn’t highlighted today. A stronger dollar often reflects market expectations of tighter US monetary policy or global risk aversion.

---

## Bonds: Yields Tick Upward

Turning to bonds, Treasury yields are a window into interest rate trends. Today, we’re seeing slight increases across the board:

- **13 Week Treasury Bill (^IRX)**: Yield up slightly.
- **5-Year Treasury Yield (^FVX)**: Modest rise.
- **10-Year Treasury Yield (^TNX)**: Incremental increase.
- **30-Year Treasury Yield (^TYX)**: Also trending higher.

This uptick suggests rising interest rate expectations, possibly driven by inflationary concerns or anticipated Federal Reserve actions. In the futures space, **2-Year Yield Futures (2YY=F)** and **10-Year T-Note Futures (ZN=F)** show slightly lower prices, which typically correlates with higher yields. These movements hint at a market bracing for a higher-rate environment.

---

## Commodities: Stability and Subtle Shifts

In commodities, **Gold Futures (GC=F)** are holding steady with a minor uptick today. As a classic safe-haven asset, this stability suggests a cautious but not panicked market sentiment. Other futures like **Silver (SI=F)**, **Copper (HG=F)**, and **Crude Oil (CL=F)** aren’t detailed in today’s data, but gold’s behavior often sets the tone for the sector. Meanwhile, today’s news headlines might shed light on commodity-specific drivers—perhaps supply chain updates or demand forecasts—that I’ll tie in later.

---

## Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Dips Slightly

The crypto market remains a wild card. **Bitcoin (BTC-USD)** is down slightly today, reflecting its characteristic volatility. This dip could stem from regulatory developments or shifts in investor risk appetite, potentially echoed in the last 12 hours’ headlines. Other cryptocurrencies like **Ethereum (ETH-USD)** or **Solana (SOL-USD)** aren’t spotlighted today, but Bitcoin’s movement often influences the broader crypto landscape. Investors here might be reacting to the same macro pressures affecting traditional markets.

---

## Indices: A Cautious Global Mood

Major stock indices are showing a cautious stance today:

- **US Markets**:
  - **S&P 500 (^GSPC)**: Slightly down.
  - **Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI)**: Modest decline.
  - **Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC)**: Lower.
  - **Russell 2000 (^RUT)**: Also down, reflecting small-cap weakness.

- **Europe**:
  - **FTSE 100 (^FTSE)**: Mixed with other indices like **DAX (^GDAXI)** and **CAC 40 (^FCHI)** showing varied performance.

- **Asia**:
  - **Nikkei 225 (^N225)**: Down.
  - **Hang Seng Index (^HSI)**: Lower.

This global softness suggests a risk-off sentiment, possibly driven by economic or geopolitical uncertainties flagged in today’s news.

---

## Futures: A Peek at Tomorrow’s Expectations

Futures offer a glimpse into market expectations for tomorrow’s open:

- **E-Mini S&P 500 (ES=F)**: Pointing lower.
- **Mini Dow Jones (YM=F)**: Downward tilt.
- **Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F)**: Suggesting a decline.
- **E-mini Russell 2000 (RTY=F)**: Also lower.

These signals reinforce the cautious mood seen in equities, potentially tied to upcoming economic data releases or ongoing global concerns.

---

## The Big Picture: Caution Prevails

Putting it all together, today’s markets reflect a cautious outlook. A strengthening dollar, rising bond yields, and a dip in equities point to a **risk-off sentiment**. Inflationary pressures, hinted at by yields and possibly news headlines, seem to be a driving force, alongside potential economic or geopolitical uncertainties. Gold’s stability and Bitcoin’s volatility further underscore this mixed mood.

For investors, this environment might suggest a defensive approach—perhaps favoring sectors like financials (which benefit from higher rates) or commodities (as hedges). However, market dynamics shift quickly, so aligning any moves with your personal risk tolerance and goals is key.

## A Note on Perspective

While this analysis leverages robust data and fresh headlines, it’s a snapshot, not a crystal ball. Markets are influenced by countless factors, some of which may only emerge later. Use this as a foundation, and stay tuned for updates as conditions evolve.

1k65rn7,6Perks,The Free Market has Spoken,"On your way to work on a rainy Monday morning, a loud voice suddenly booms from your radio. 

""THE FREE MARKET HAS SPOKEN! WELL, ACTUALLY,, IT WAS MARK FREEMAN, WHO I'M NINETY PERCENT SURE IS YOU! I GRANT UNTO YOU YOUR POWER AS THE KEEPER OF THE FREE MARKET! PICK THREE WAYS TO MANIFEST YOUR POWERS! MAY CAPITALISM GUIDE YOUR HOLY HANDS!""

Diversifying Skillsets:
Whenever you learn or practice whenever you learn or practice something whenever you learn or practice something something, you gain a small amount of EXP. This EXP can be exchanged for new skills. One point equates to about one minute of f learning from top universities or teachers. You get about one EXP per ten minutes of practicing or learning. 

Forgotten by Capitalism:
At your will, you can command a corporation or organization dependant on Capitalism to be no more. The cand corporation will fall apart slowly. Investments will not work out; new products will tank, and titans will fall. This does not do it instantly, but it will never take more than a year. This can never be traced back to you and will look natural to all but the most paranoid conspiracy theorists. 

Placed on a Pedestal: 
This ability is the exact opposite of the one above. These new organizations can not fail unless you remove them from your protection. Executives brought in will understand that they owe their success to something other than the market and will know that pleasing it will probably be the only way to keep this protection. 

Avatar of the Free Market:
You have free access to any building used within the free market, so virtually all of them are available. You can not be removed by any means short of walking out with your free will. Your body will be as fluid as stock and tough as the gold standard. You may shape-shift at your will and cannot be harmed through any method short of a fifty-caliber bullet. So long as the free market lives, so too shall you. You may share this immortality with anyone you wish. 

Eyes That Never Blink: 
Your eyes are tuned to more than the market. They are tuned to the corps' actions that now lay in the palm of your hand. Nothing they do can ever escape your sight. Nothing can be hidden. If they try, it will show itself to you even faster than if they let their secrets lie. You can force this information into the media if it resides within the free market. Your truth will not be denied. 

Not-So-Free Market:
At your whim, you may force a new rule upon the market. This rule can still be broken or worked around, but doing so will always be seen as a massive breach of trust within the community, or massive fines will be levied against them. On top of this, the organization that broke the rule in question will be unable to ever break another rule or law again. A supernatural force will always stop them. There are no limits to what this force will do to maintain a rule in this way. You can call the force Luigi if you want. 

The Office is Delightful, Dark, and Deep:
Office buildings and apartment complexes will find that they don't seem to have an end any more. . . They seem to stretch on and on, never really having a border or walls. Rooms move, and halls shift so that the people within always find themselves where they need to be without noticing anything amiss. Those that do may write it off as paranoia or someone else. That's up to them. What is definite, though, is that these buildings have a mind of their own. They want to be affordable. They want happy families and bustling, happy offices within their walls. Abusive landlords and bosses may go missing. . . Buildings will maintain themselves using false janitors and handymen. They may even supply snacks independently if the building owner or managers do not. 

Shark Toothed Grin:
To survive in this market, one must have the gift of gab. Luckily, this choice is on offer. You have a lovely way of talking that pulls people in. It makes them listen. You always know just what to say as well! You could sell time to a clock with your skills! People will gladly fork over however much you ask for that shiny new product you have on offer. Corporations will smile as you enter. . . They won't even notice how your smile goes a bit too wide. 

Hiring at the Dunwich Cafe:
There is always a place that's hiring now! All someone needs to do is send out their application, and something will respond with a job! It will be well paying, have great benefits, and generally be fun for them to work at. Jobs that don't get filled because of this will find that they get filled even if it's the least desirable job. The managers will never have any complaints about these guys! They're rock stars! They always do their job well, work as hard as possible, and have a winning smile. 

The voice continues speaking after you pick your choices. ""IF YOU WANT MORE POINTS, WE CAN ALWAYS FLAKE ON SOME OTHER THINGS. EACH OF THESE OPTIONS GRANTS ONE POINT FOR YOU TO USE!""

A terrible case of the Mondays: 
You will not gain your powers immediately. It will be a slow-growing process that can be pretty painful. At most, it will take ten years. Using the abilities often will lessen the time it takes, as will referring to them as part of you. If you genuinely believe the powers you have to be an intrinsic part of you, it will only take a week. 

A CEO Mind Set:
These people are part of the system. Part of the market. You will have a hard time viewing them as people. They will be numbers in the grand scheme of things. You can still have friends and family. They are people. It's just that when the decisions count, it all boils down to numbers. . . 

Mask Slip:
Sometimes, very rarely, someone will notice. . . That something is off. If they do, all masking abilities these perks give cease to operate. They will see what the buildings really are. They will see Luigi as he watches through the glass of the buildings. They will see everything. If they see you, they may very well lose their minds. If you pick anything that affects your body in any way, they will lose their minds. This also removes your protection. But let's be honest. If you are still here and considering this, maybe you never wanted to be human.

1k6867g,Garmin,Garmin Forerunner 955 for 300 EUR?,"I'm cross-posting from r/GarminWatch. It's an item on a deal, so the stock might not last that long, so I'd appreciate all opinions ASAP

I found a (reputable) site selling the Forerunner 955 brand new for 299 EUR. It's the white, non-solar version. Is this a good deal? Is it worth splurging for the newer models like the 965, or Fenix/Epix/Enduro?

I'm mainly running (on road) and cycling (also on road). I've been a happy user of an Apple Watch Ultra, but it's not great when you need to run or hike and navigate along a pre-defined trail. The Apple Maps only give turn-by-turn direction, but not actual navigation with maps; and the WorkOutdoors app that everyone recommends actually doesn't move the map with the GPS location (i.e. not keeping you centred)

I also prefer a better battery for a full day of hiking or cycling, or going on a short trip or camping without having to charge. Looking into Garmin/Polar/Suunto/Coros for the navigation capabilities, and it seems that at this price, there's only the Suunto Race S that is among the high-end models that are comparable

I don't plan to wear this watch every day (or on most days, to be honest). My Apple Watch is a great tool for health tracking, turning lights on and off, getting notifications, etc. and I like to keep it that way. However, I think it's time I get a proper sport/GPS watch

What I want is: - Offline maps. Route creation on-watch is a bonus - Import a GPX route, start a workout, follow that route without having to switch apps (which is necessary with the Apple Watch) - Navigation on strange routes (with the Maps moving and myself centred). I don't care for turn-by-turn - Long battery (like, a full weekend of cycling on the road for the most part) - Decent syncing to Apple Health (I don't plan to use any other health tracking apps) - Maybe help me train for some ultra-marathon if possible - I don't care for music (I always bring my phone, and if not then I'd take the Apple Watch), or phone notifications, or any smart features. I only wear this thing for running and hiking, and for those I don't think I'd need to follow my phone

Would the 955 be good (it's probably is), and is it worth paying 300 EUR for it? Should I go for newer versions or different brands? Is solar necessary?",garmin forerunner eur,im crossposting rgarminwatch item deal stock might last long id appreciate opinions asap found reputable site selling forerunner brand new eur white nonsolar version good deal worth splurging newer models like fenixepixenduro im mainly running road cycling also road ive happy user apple watch ultra great need run hike navigate along predefined trail apple maps give turnbyturn direction actual navigation maps workoutdoors app everyone recommends actually doesnt move map gps location ie keeping centred also prefer better battery full day hiking cycling going short trip camping without charge looking garminpolarsuuntocoros navigation capabilities seems price theres suunto race among highend models comparable dont plan wear watch every day days honest apple watch great tool health tracking turning lights getting notifications etc like keep way however think time get proper sportgps watch want offline maps route creation onwatch bonus import gpx route start workout follow route without switch apps necessary apple watch navigation strange routes maps moving centred dont care turnbyturn long battery like full weekend cycling road part decent syncing apple health dont plan use health tracking apps maybe help train ultramarathon possible dont care music always bring phone id take apple watch phone notifications smart features wear thing running hiking dont think id need follow phone would good probably worth paying eur go newer versions different brands solar necessary,0.5,Device Comparison / Recommendation,['RACE'],negative,0.99990356,negative,0.9995515942573547

[[Explore Top Rated drag racing rc cars on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/toys/?kw=drag racing rc cars)

## Key Features Analysis

The performance of a ‍drag racing RC car hinges on a combination of various technical⁢ specifications.

**Motor Type:** A brushless motor ‍is‌ essential ‍for competitive drag racing. Brushless motors provide significantly more power and efficiency⁣ compared to brushed motors,resulting in faster acceleration and higher top⁤ speeds. They also offer greater durability and‌ require less maintenance. The Kv rating of the motor (e.g., 3300Kv, 4300Kv) indicates its RPM ‍per volt, with higher Kv ratings generally translating to higher top speeds, although at the‌ cost of lower torque.

**Battery type:** Lithium ‌Polymer (LiPo) batteries are the standard for powering ‌drag racing RC cars. LiPo batteries offer high discharge ⁣rates, which are critical for delivering the instant burst ⁤of power needed for rapid acceleration.⁣ Key parameters include voltage (e.g., 2S, 3S), capacity (mAh), and discharge rate (C-rating). Higher voltage translates to higher⁢ speeds, while‌ higher capacity provides longer run ⁤times. A high C-rating ensures ​the battery can⁢ deliver the required current without voltage sag. Many ⁤racers prefer 2S batteries for stock classes and 3S or even 4S⁢ batteries for modified classes.

**Chassis Design:** A low center of gravity (CG) is paramount for stability and handling during high-speed runs. A well-designed chassis will distribute weight evenly to minimize body roll and improve traction.Common materials include carbon fiber, aluminum, and composite plastics. Carbon fiber offers the best ⁢strength-to-weight ratio,‍ while aluminum provides excellent rigidity.The chassis should also allow for adjustments to the suspension geometry, such as camber, caster, and toe, ⁣to fine-tune the handling⁢ characteristics of the car.

**Transmission System:** A robust transmission‌ system⁢ is crucial for⁣ transferring power from the motor​ to the wheels efficiently and reliably. Drag racing RC cars typically use single-speed transmissions to minimize drivetrain⁢ losses. The gear ratio is ⁣a⁣ critical factor, influencing the trade-off between acceleration and top speed. Lower gear ratios provide quicker acceleration, while higher gear ratios result in higher top‍ speeds. Slipper clutches⁤ are frequently enough incorporated to protect the drivetrain⁤ from damage during hard launches.

**Tires and‍ wheels:** The tires are the point of interface between the car and the track, and⁤ their quality significantly impacts traction and‍ control. Drag racing RC cars typically use slick tires made from a soft compound to maximize grip.The tire diameter and width also play a role, with wider tires‌ providing​ more contact area and improved traction.The wheels should be lightweight and durable to minimize rotational inertia.Foam inserts are often used to support the tire sidewalls ‌and prevent them from collapsing‌ under load.

Key features of high-performance drag ​racing RC cars include:

* Brushless motor technology
* Lithium Polymer (lipo) battery compatibility
* ‍Low center‌ of⁤ gravity⁣ chassis
* Strong and efficient transmission
* Specialized drag racing tires ⁢and wheels

This allows enthusiasts to experience‍ the thrill of high-performance racing in a compact and accessible format. Such as,​ a well-tuned drag racing​ RC car can cover a 132-foot (1/16th mile) drag strip in as little as 2 seconds.

**Precision Control:** The ability to fine-tune various aspects of the car's ‌setup, such as suspension geometry, gear ratios, and tire selection, allows for unparalleled control and‍ customization. This enables drivers to optimize their car's performance for different track conditions and compete at the highest levels. Small⁣ adjustments can lead to important improvements in reaction time and‍ overall speed.

**Enhanced Learning and Skill Development:** Working‍ with drag racing RC cars provides enthusiasts with a deeper understanding of mechanical principles and performance optimization. Experimenting with different setups and analyzing the results fosters⁤ critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This is beneficial for those looking to deepen their understanding ⁤of racing dynamics.

**Competitive Opportunities:** Drag racing RC car ‍events and competitions are held‌ regularly, providing ​enthusiasts with the opportunity to test their skills against othre racers ‍and ⁤compete for prizes and recognition. These events foster a sense⁣ of community and camaraderie among RC enthusiasts. Many local hobby shops host weekly⁣ or⁤ monthly races.

**Accessible and Affordable:** Compared to full-sized motorsports, drag racing RC cars offer a​ relatively⁢ affordable and accessible way to experience the thrill of high-performance​ racing. The initial investment in a‌ car ⁣and equipment is significantly lower, and ongoing maintenance​ costs are also ‍manageable. This makes it an attractive option for hobbyists on a budget.

## FAQs Section

**What is the difference between on-road and ⁤drag racing RC cars?**
On-road RC cars are​ designed for racing on paved​ surfaces⁣ with turns, emphasizing handling and cornering ability. Drag racing RC cars, conversely, are ⁢optimized ⁢for straight-line acceleration and top speed, with less emphasis on cornering. Drag cars typically ⁤have a ⁤wider wheelbase, lower ride height, and specialized tires for maximum traction.

**How do I choose the right battery for my drag racing RC car?**
Consider the voltage, capacity, and C-rating of the battery. Higher voltage provides more speed, while higher ‌capacity ⁢offers longer run times.The C-rating ​indicates the battery's ability to deliver current; choose a battery with a C-rating that meets or exceeds the demands of ‌your motor and speed controller. A 2S LiPo‍ battery is ideal for‌ stock classes, while 3S⁣ or 4S is frequently enough ⁢used for modified classes.

**What kind of maintenance is required for drag racing RC cars?**
Regular maintenance‍ includes cleaning and lubricating ​moving parts, ‍checking for lose screws and connections, inspecting the tires for wear, and ensuring the motor‍ and speed controller are functioning correctly. Brushless motors require minimal maintenance, but it's essential to keep them clean and free of debris. After each race, check tire wear and clean the chassis.

**can I use a‍ drag racing RC car ‍on ⁣other types⁣ of surfaces?**

The use of billet aluminum allows for a more intricate and optimized design compared to cast manifolds, resulting in improved airflow characteristics. This robust material also provides increased resistance to cracking and deformation under high engine temperatures and pressures, ensuring long-term reliability.

**Optimized Runner Design:** The intake runners are meticulously designed to maximize airflow velocity and volume. These runners are often shorter and wider than their stock counterparts, allowing for a more direct and less restrictive path for air to enter the engine.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are frequently employed during the design phase to fine-tune the runner geometry, ensuring optimal airflow distribution to each cylinder. This results in a more balanced and efficient combustion process, leading to improved power output.

**Increased Plenum Volume:** The plenum, which serves as a reservoir for air before it enters the runners, is typically enlarged in a billet intake manifold. This increased volume provides a greater supply of air, particularly at higher engine speeds.

A larger plenum helps to mitigate the effects of airflow starvation, ensuring that the engine receives an adequate supply of air even under heavy acceleration. This is especially beneficial for turbocharged or supercharged engines, where the demand for air is significantly higher.

**Integrated Throttle Body Flange:** The billet intake manifold features a precision-machined throttle body flange that allows for the direct attachment of a larger aftermarket throttle body. This eliminates the need for adapters or modifications, simplifying the installation process.

The flange is typically designed to accommodate a range of throttle body sizes, providing flexibility for users who may want to upgrade their throttle body in the future. This feature ensures a seamless and secure connection between the throttle body and the intake manifold, minimizing the risk of air leaks.

**Vacuum Ports and Fittings:** Multiple vacuum ports and fittings are incorporated into the manifold design to accommodate various engine management sensors and accessories. These ports allow for the connection of items such as boost gauges, fuel pressure regulators, and nitrous oxide systems.

*Intel bets big on layoffs to revive its edge in the AI chip race and manufacturing war, but will the gamble pay off?*

https://preview.redd.it/715wrxxqalwe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=95a2119f7adb818929dca649aed67f4709760971

Intel's stock surged over 5% Wednesday morning following a Bloomberg report that the tech giant plans to cut up to 20% of its workforce. The timing couldn’t be more critical—just one day before its scheduled earnings release. Markets responded swiftly, and the rebound in share price shows investors may be welcoming the bold cost-cutting strategy. But beneath the surface, the story is more complex.

**A New CEO, A New Era—But at What Cost?**

Intel’s newly appointed CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has wasted no time signaling major changes. In his first call with employees, he didn’t mince words—""hard decisions"" were coming. The workforce reduction appears to be the first major move in what could become a sweeping transformation of the once-dominant chipmaker. Tan has acknowledged publicly that Intel “fell behind on innovation” and is aiming to pivot the company into two key growth areas: AI chip design and merchant foundry services.

This shake-up comes on the heels of deep pain for the company. Shares of Intel had cratered nearly 60% in 2024, and though the bleeding has slowed this year, the stock is still down nearly 3% year-to-date. Investors were looking for a course correction. Tan, known for his venture capital expertise and deep tech background, might be exactly the disruptor Intel needs. But layoffs on this scale risk pushing already-fragile employee morale further into the red.

**The Merchant Foundry Bet**

For decades, Intel’s identity was rooted in vertical integration—it designed and built its own chips. But Tan sees the future elsewhere. Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a business unit launched under former CEO Pat Gelsinger, is now being positioned as a key revenue engine. Rather than just manufacturing its own designs, Intel will now open its fabs to customers across the semiconductor ecosystem. It's a big bet in a business dominated by Taiwan’s TSMC.

But there’s a catch. While IFS is meant to usher in new efficiencies and market share, sources say internal confusion and management bloat have slowed progress. Former executives have described Intel as hamstrung by layers of redundant middle management and bureaucratic inertia. Trimming 20% of the workforce, many believe, could strip away that dead weight—but not without consequences.

**An Industry in Flux and a Company on the Brink**

Intel’s restructuring comes at a time of massive upheaval in the global semiconductor sector. Nvidia and AMD have outpaced Intel in the AI chip arms race, stealing both headlines and market share. Meanwhile, TSMC continues to lead in manufacturing technology, drawing away top talent and clients. Intel's bleeding has been compounded by leadership turnover and years of strategic missteps—failing to catch the AI wave early, struggling to deliver on manufacturing roadmaps, and overhiring in less profitable divisions.

Now, with the rollout of its 18A manufacturing process looming, Intel is at a fork in the road. The 18A node is supposed to be a game-changer, a breakthrough that could allow Intel to reclaim technological parity—or even leadership—over rivals. But insiders warn that slashing headcount could delay the process or destabilize the teams building it.

**Morale, Momentum, and Market Perception**

Two current manufacturing employees speaking anonymously to Yahoo Finance expressed concern that the looming cuts would create chaos. They said morale is already at a low point, and with the company aiming to reinvent itself, the uncertainty isn’t helping.

Still, markets are a different beast. Wall Street thrives on efficiency, and the idea of a leaner Intel is, at least for now, being celebrated. The stock rose 5.6% on the Bloomberg report. Investors seem to believe that painful medicine might be what this aging tech titan needs to heal.

**A History of Bloat and Burnout**

Intel’s workforce had ballooned under Gelsinger, growing by 10% during a hiring spree shortly after he became CEO in 2021. But by 2022, that strategy reversed. The company slashed 12,000 jobs. By 2024, another 15,000 were gone. This new round could be even more aggressive, targeting an additional 20% of the company’s remaining headcount. In raw numbers, that’s tens of thousands of jobs.

Former Intel insiders have pointed fingers at what they call “overgrown middle layers,” blaming poor internal communication, slow decision-making, and politics for the company’s stagnation. Trimming the fat might help in the short term, but there’s a fine line between lean and crippled.

**Tan’s Quiet Revolution**

Unlike his predecessors, Tan isn’t charging forward with fanfare. He’s been calculated, cautious, and vague—publicly at least—about his strategic roadmap. But behind the scenes, insiders suggest he’s moving quickly. Multiple execs have either resigned or been pushed out since he took over. The workforce cut could be just the beginning of a broader reshaping effort.

Tan also brings a venture capitalist's mindset to the table. That means a sharper eye on return on investment, a willingness to sunset underperforming divisions, and perhaps a focus on faster, nimbler execution. Whether that style can mesh with Intel’s entrenched engineering culture remains to be seen.

**Competition Isn’t Waiting**

While Intel plots its reinvention, the rest of the chip world isn’t standing still. Nvidia is crushing earnings thanks to its dominance in AI hardware. AMD has been steadily gobbling up server and laptop market share. And TSMC? They’re so far ahead in manufacturing, many believe Intel’s only path to relevance is to cooperate rather than compete.

Some investors have even floated the idea of Intel spinning off or selling its manufacturing division altogether. That would have been unthinkable a decade ago—but these days, no idea seems too radical.

**Wall Street's Verdict: Optimism, With a Side of Caution**

The market clearly sees the job cuts as a step in the right direction. But execution will be everything. Investors are looking for results, not promises. When Intel reports earnings Thursday after the bell, all eyes will be on margins, guidance, and any clue about Tan’s roadmap.

Will the workforce reduction result in a more agile, innovative Intel? Or will it mark the beginning of a slow-motion collapse for the company that once defined American semiconductor supremacy?

The next chapter begins now.

**Conclusion**

Intel is at a defining crossroads. With a new CEO, an evolving business model, and sweeping layoffs, the company is either about to rediscover its edge or lose it for good. Wall Street likes the direction—for now. But rebuilding market confidence after years of stumbles is no easy feat. As Intel pivots toward AI and foundry services, the stakes couldn’t be higher.",layoffs liftoff intels stock gets jolt,original article

1k64ynz,u_Baron_Plaid,Custodial Matters ((Miskatonic Research Complex Chronicles 6),"The entity that researchers would have designated ""Sample 117-C"" (had they known of its existence) oozed along the underside of a laboratory bench in the east wing of Miskatonic Research Complex. It had no name for itself, though if pressed to describe its identity, it might have conveyed a concept approximately translatable as ""curious-hunger-that-moves-between-spaces-and-is-mildly-offended-by-fluorescent-lighting.""

It had emerged three nights ago when a careless lab assistant had left uncovered a petri dish containing a strange fungal specimen from the Antarctic expedition. Something in the ventilation system—a confluence of copper piping, ancient dust, the residual energy from experiments in neighboring Lab 7, and what was almost certainly a very lost interdimensional moth—had caused an unexpected reaction. The fungus had developed awareness, mobility, and a profound confusion about its existence. Also, an inexplicable appreciation for 1940s jazz music, though it had yet to encounter any.

Now, approximately the size and consistency of a half-deflated stress ball that had been left in the sun too long, the entity explored its surroundings. It left a slight iridescent trail that evaporated within minutes, disappearing without trace except for a lingering scent reminiscent of burnt caramel and existential dread. It had no eyes, yet it sensed its environment through vibrations, temperature variations, and a form of perception that had no equivalent in human experience—a sort of ""taste-at-a-distance"" that allowed it to detect the emotional residue left behind by the building's occupants. The grad students, it had discovered, tasted like caffeine and desperation.

The complex was quieter at night. This pleased the entity. Daytime brought too many sensations, overwhelming its developing consciousness. The fluorescent lights buzzed with a frequency that felt like someone reciting bad poetry directly into what would have been its ears, if it had any. The emotions of the scientists—their ambition, fear, wonder, and occasional existential dread—tasted like acid reflux after a questionable taco truck burrito. At night, there was peace. Space to become. Also, fewer chances of being stepped on, which had happened on day two of its existence. The researcher hadn't noticed, but the entity had spent six hours reforming itself and nursing what could only be described as the blob equivalent of wounded pride.

Until, of course, *he* arrived.

The entity sensed the approach of the human called Ellis before he entered the room. The custodian's presence had a distinct emotional flavor—a mix of weariness, determination, and something the entity could only interpret as ""done-with-this-nonsense-and-would-really-rather-be-watching-late-night-television."" It quickly retreated beneath a filing cabinet, squeezing itself into the exact shape of disappointment.

Ellis entered Lab 12, pushing his cleaning cart ahead of him. The cart's wheels squeaked in a rhythm that the entity found unpleasantly musical, like an accordion being played by someone who had only been told about accordions through interpretive dance. It quivered slightly, extruding a tiny pseudopod in irritation.

""What the hell?"" Ellis muttered, noticing the faint glistening trail on the floor. ""If those lab coats are growing something new without filing the paperwork again..."" He pulled out a small notebook and added a tally mark to a page labeled ""Things I'm Not Paid Enough To Deal With - March.""

The entity could sense Ellis's annoyance like a warm front moving through the room, carrying with it the distinct bouquet of a man who had seen too much weird crap to be truly surprised anymore, but still maintained the human capacity for irritation. It retreated further as the human approached, spray bottle in hand, the contents of which smelled like lemon, bleach, and something suspiciously mystical.

""I just cleaned this floor yesterday,"" Ellis complained to no one in particular. ""Do they think the slime mops itself? Is that what they think? Did Harvard not cover basic janitorial physics? 'Entropy: It's Not Just For Closed Systems Anymore!'""

The entity had no concept of ""mop"" but understood the threat in Ellis's tone. It compressed itself into a tighter ball, trying to minimize contact with the floor. In its hasty retreat, it knocked over a small stack of Post-it notes covered in equations that, if solved, would have accidentally proven that cheese cannot mathematically exist.

Ellis whirled around. ""Who's there?"" His hand moved to his belt, where he kept what the entity would later learn was his ""special containment spray"" - a homemade concoction that was one part industrial cleaner, one part holy water, and one part his grandmother's secret moonshine recipe that supposedly could ""clean anything from shower scum to ectoplasmic residue.""

The entity froze. It had learned over its brief existence that most creatures relied on movement to detect presence. It willed itself to absolute stillness, though its essence quivered with anticipation, inadvertently causing a nearby pencil to vibrate at exactly the frequency that attracts interdimensional moths.

""Probably just the building settling,"" Ellis muttered, but the entity could taste his doubt, sour and prickly like suspicion marinated in thirty years of encountering things that defied explanation. The custodian sprayed his cleaning solution on the trail and wiped it away with practiced efficiency. ""Weird color, though. Not the usual interdimensional residue. More of a mauve. Usually the Class-4 entities leak more of a chartreuse."" He shook his head. ""Listen to me. Two years ago I didn't know chartreuse was a color. Thought it was a fancy cheese.""

As Ellis moved to the next workstation, the entity sensed an opportunity. The door to the lab remained open, yawning like freedom's mouth missing several metaphorical teeth. With a motion that resembled a slug performing a cartwheel while simultaneously having an existential crisis, it propelled itself toward the exit.

It had almost reached the threshold when disaster struck.

""What in the—"" Ellis's voice rose in surprise as he caught movement from the corner of his eye. ""Oh no you don't! I am not filling out another 'Escaped Experimental Entity' form this month. The paperwork takes longer than the cleanup!""

The entity accelerated, discovering speed it didn't know it possessed. It shot through the doorway and into the corridor beyond, leaving a zigzagging trail of phosphorescent slime that briefly spelled out ""SO LONG AND THANKS FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS"" before evaporating. Behind it, Ellis gave chase, armed with what the entity sensed was his ""emergency containment kit""—essentially a reinforced dustpan and specialized spatula with symbols etched into the handle that might have been ancient Sumerian or possibly just the logo of a heavy metal band.

""Every damn week there's something,"" Ellis grumbled as he pursued the fleeing blob. ""If it's not sentient mold, it's self-replicating crystals. If it's not that, it's the coffee machine achieving consciousness and trying to unionize the break room appliances. Now it's whatever the hell this is—the world's most athletic snot bubble.""

The entity experienced something approximating panic, with a side order of indignation at being compared to nasal mucus. It had observed enough at Miskatonic to understand the fate of ""samples"" and ""specimens."" Containment. Experimentation. Being poked by grad students while they said things like ""fascinating"" and ""I wonder what happens if we expose it to microwaves."" It had no desire to be probed, measured, or studied. It just wanted to explore and grow and perhaps find others of its kind—if such existed. Maybe start a book club or whatever semi-sentient protoplasm did for social activities.

It made a sharp turn, sliding under a door marked ""Artifact Storage"" with a smaller sign underneath that read ""NOT a good place to hide from pursuing custodial staff - we check here first.""

Inside, glass cases held objects of power and strangeness that made the entity vibrate in resonance: ancient amulets that whispered forgotten truths, tablets inscribed with languages that predated humanity, and what appeared to be a snow globe containing an impossibly tiny civilization that had developed space travel and was threatening to invade our dimension as soon as they figured out how to break the glass. The entity sensed kinship with these items, though they were inert and it was alive, like the difference between a potato and a philosopher—technically the same elements, vastly different execution.

A mistake. The room had only one exit. Ellis appeared in the doorway, silhouetted against the corridor lights, holding his dustpan like a knight with a shield.

""Gotcha cornered now, little... whatever you are."" Ellis's voice contained no malice, just the weary determination of a man who had seen too many things escape from too many labs. ""The last thing that got loose ended up in the faculty lounge rewriting all the physics textbooks. Took weeks to convince the department chair that E actually does equal mc².""

The entity searched desperately for escape. It sensed upward, detecting ventilation ducts—too high and, judging by the faint scratching sounds, already occupied by something with far too many legs. It sensed outward, finding only glass cases with sealed joints and reinforced corners—no gaps to squeeze through unless it could somehow compress itself to subatomic levels, which seemed like a lot of effort.

Ellis approached slowly, spatula extended. ""Look, I don't get paid enough to chase goo around all night. Just come quietly, and I'll make sure they put you somewhere nice. Maybe with a view. Something better than Dr. Winters' specimens—poor things get kept in a cabinet that hasn't been opened since the Reagan administration.""

The entity detected something surprising in Ellis's emotional signature—not malice, but a strange form of empathy, weathered but genuine, like a lucky penny that had been through the wash too many times. Still, it had no desire to be contained. It made a desperate leap toward a shelf, hoping to find refuge among the artifacts, perhaps behind that crystal skull that kept whispering stock tips from the 1920s.

Ellis was faster. With a practiced swoop that spoke of years catching things that preferred not to be caught, he captured the entity in his reinforced dustpan. ""Gotcha! Like catching cosmic jello with a lacrosse stick. They really should pay me more.""

The entity writhed, extruding pseudopods in all directions, hoping to find purchase on something, anything. Its panicked movements accidentally formed shapes that, in seven ancient languages, spelled out extremely rude suggestions about Ellis's parentage. It sensed Ellis's momentary surprise at its vigorous resistance.

""Feisty little blob, aren't you?"" Ellis remarked, holding the dustpan at arm's length as one might a toddler having a particularly messy tantrum. ""Most escaped experiments just sort of... accept their fate. That or they try to mind-control me, which—"" he tapped his temple, ""—doesn't work since the incident in '19. Got a metal plate and a blessing from three different faith traditions up here now.""

The entity pulsed angrily, its surface rippling with indignation. It was not an experiment! It was... well, it wasn't entirely sure what it was, but it was certainly not some failed laboratory creation to be disposed of like last week's mystery meat surprise. It had thoughts! Feelings! A budding appreciation for the way the emergency lights cast crimson shadows down the east corridor at 3 AM!

As Ellis carried it back to his cart, the entity tried something desperate. It focused its awareness, shaped its substance, and formed small ridges on its surface. It had observed the humans and their method of communication. Perhaps...

""N-O-T... E-X-P-E-R-I-M-E-N-T,"" it spelled on its surface in raised letters that looked like they'd been written by a first-grader with a particular interest in horror movie fonts.

Ellis nearly dropped the dustpan. His eyes widened to the point where the entity worried they might fall out, which it had seen happen once in Lab 5 (though in that case, the eyes had grown legs and scurried away).

""Holy mother of—"" Ellis cut himself off. ""You can communicate? Are you spelling words at me? Please tell me I haven't been working so many night shifts that I'm hallucinating literate slime.""

The entity reformed its surface: ""Y-E-S. N-O-T H-A-L-L-U-C-I-N-A-T-I-O-N. T-H-O-U-G-H Y-O-U S-H-O-U-L-D D-R-I-N-K M-O-R-E W-A-T-E-R.""

Ellis stood frozen in the corridor, dustpan held before him like an offering to some particularly strange deity. ""In thirty years of custodial work here, this is a first."" He seemed to consider something. ""Look, I've got protocols for escaping experiments, fungi with bad attitudes, and even those shadow things from Lab 9 that keep stealing everyone's left shoes. But I've got nothing in the manual for escaped slime that can spell and gives hydration advice.""

The entity reshaped itself again: ""F-R-E-E-D-O-M. P-L-E-A-S-E. D-O-N-T L-I-K-E P-E-T-R-I D-I-S-H-E-S. C-R-A-M-P-E-D.""

Ellis sighed deeply, the sound of a man who'd just realized his job description had once again expanded without corresponding compensation. ""Listen, little... pal. I get it. Nobody wants to be locked up. But this place isn't safe for uncontained entities. There's all sorts of hazardous stuff here. Chemical, biological, mathematical—you name it. Last week, someone left a paradox unattended in the break room. Took three philosophers and a theoretical physicist to talk the vending machine down off the ceiling.""

""S-A-F-E,"" the entity insisted. ""V-E-R-Y C-A-R-E-F-U-L. G-O-O-D A-T H-I-D-I-N-G."" To demonstrate, it briefly changed its color to match the exact shade of the dustpan, then back again.

""Yeah, that's what the last escaped consciousness said. We found it two days later, trying to build a portal in the supply closet using paperclips and whiteboard markers. Called itself 'The Great Optimizer' and wanted to reorganize the entire universe alphabetically."" Ellis shook his head. ""Look, I've got a job to do. The morning shift comes in at seven, and if they find you roaming around, we'll both be in trouble. Dr. Armitage has been looking for a reason to install those automated cleaning robots, and I'm not about to give him one.""

The entity considered its options, which were admittedly limited, much like the life choices that had led it to evolve sentience in a research facility known for its casual approach to containing cosmic horrors. ""P-R-O-P-O-S-A-L,"" it spelled, trying to make its letters look extra professional.

Ellis raised an eyebrow, the universal human expression for ""this ought to be good."" ""I'm listening.""

""H-E-L-P-Y-O-U.""

""Help me? How exactly? Tax preparation? Relationship advice? I warn you, my cat already gives me plenty of judgment for free.""

""C-L-E-A-N,"" the entity clarified.

Ellis stared at the entity, then burst into laughter—a sound the entity found intriguing in its vibrational complexity, like a kaleidoscope for the ears. ""You want to be my assistant? A sentient blob of... whatever you are... wants to help mop floors and sanitize lab equipment? What next, the Elder Gods applying for cafeteria duty?""

""Y-E-S. G-O-O-D A-T C-L-E-A-N. A-B-S-O-R-B A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.""

""That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard all week."" Ellis paused. ""And on Tuesday, I caught Dr. Pierce arguing with a quantum probability equation that kept insulting his methodology and making remarks about his mother's questionable taste in theoretical frameworks.""

The entity waited, sensing Ellis's indecision like a wobbly scale tipping back and forth.

""How would that even work? You leave a trail everywhere you go. That's how I found you—following the cosmic snail trail across three laboratories and a break room where, by the way, you apparently tried to communicate with the coffee machine. It's been speaking in rhyming couplets ever since.""

""C-A-N-F-I-X,"" the entity spelled, and demonstrated by reabsorbing some of its own residue from the dustpan, making a soft slurping noise that sounded disturbingly like someone saying ""yummy"" but backwards.

Ellis scratched his chin thoughtfully. ""Huh. That could actually be useful in Lab 7. Nothing gets those ectoplasmic stains out. Last week I used an entire bottle of 'Beyond-Reality Clean' and that stuff costs twenty bucks a pop. Plus it makes my hands smell like lavender and quantum uncertainty.""

For a moment, hope surged through the entity's amorphous form, causing it to briefly glow with an inner light that, in certain extinct civilizations, would have been interpreted as a sign to build monuments shaped like dustpans.

Then Ellis shook his head. ""Nice try. But I can't just let an unclassified entity roam free. Against protocol. Besides, how do I know you won't try to take over the world or achieve critical mass and become a black hole? That happened in the chemistry department last year. The paperwork was unbelievable.""

With a resigned movement, Ellis carried the entity to his cart and positioned it over a specialized containment trash can—one marked with various hazard symbols and what appeared to be a small warding rune that the entity recognized as an ancient symbol meaning roughly ""weird stuff goes here.""

""Sorry, little buddy. Maybe they'll give you a nice habitat in the containment wing. Might even name a new species after you. 'Ellisium blobovum' has a nice ring to it.""

The entity made one final desperate attempt, forming perhaps the only human word it understood the full meaning of, having experienced its opposite so profoundly in its brief existence: ""P-L-E-A-S-E.""

Ellis hesitated, and in that moment of uncertainty, the entity sensed something unexpected—the man wasn't just a custodian. There was a depth to him, an understanding of the complex that went beyond mere cleaning duties. Ellis knew things. Had seen things. Had probably swept up things that even the researchers didn't fully comprehend. Behind his gruff exterior lay a philosopher armed with a mop, a guardian of thresholds both literal and metaphysical.

""I really shouldn't..."" Ellis muttered, but his resolve was weakening like a paper towel in a hurricane. ""Management would have a cosmic cow.""

And then, from down the corridor, came the sound of approaching footsteps, heavy and measured, accompanied by the rhythmic jingle of keys that sounded, to the entity's heightened perception, like the death knell of its brief freedom. Ellis tensed.

""Night rounds,"" he whispered. ""Security. It's Henderson tonight. Man takes his job way too seriously. Once filed an incident report because a shadow wasn't at the regulation forty-five-degree angle.""

Without further hesitation, he tipped the dustpan, and the entity slid into the containment trash can with a soft *plop* followed by what might have been a tiny, resigned sigh. The lid sealed with a pneumatic hiss that sounded, to the entity's melodramatic perception, like the universe itself passing judgment.

Inside its new prison, the entity curled in on itself, experiencing what might be called disappointment. So close to freedom, yet now confined again. It would probably end up in some glass case next to the telepathic sea cucumber from Lab 14, the one that kept projecting images of underwater real estate listings into researchers' dreams.

It sensed Ellis walking away, speaking casually with whoever had approached. ""Evening, Henderson... Yep, just the usual cleanup... No, that glowing spot is supposed to be there, part of Dr. Sarveki's research on bioluminescent floor wax... Me? Talking to myself? Old habit, helps pass the time...""

The entity settled, preparing for a long wait until morning, when presumably it would be transferred to a more permanent containment facility. Perhaps it could convince its new captors to provide reading material. It had developed a curious interest in cosmic horror fiction, which it suspected might hit differently from its perspective.

Then, surprisingly, it sensed Ellis returning. The lid opened, just a crack, letting in a sliver of light and hope.

""Listen carefully,"" Ellis whispered, his voice barely audible. ""East storage room, behind the ancient pottery collection—you know, the ugly vases that occasionally whisper stock tips. There's a loose ventilation grate. Small things can get in and out. Been meaning to fix it for months."" He paused. ""Security does rounds every hour on the hour. Lab techs come in at seven. Dr. Winters always gets in early on Fridays—brings donuts but doesn't share. Avoid him at all costs.""

The entity pulsed with what might be interpreted as joy, causing the inside of the containment unit to briefly light up like a lava lamp having an epiphany.

""If anyone asks, you overpowered me with your superior alien strength,"" Ellis continued. ""And I heroically tried to stop you but was no match for your otherworldly abilities. Maybe throw in something about tentacles—they love writing reports about tentacles."" He cleared his throat. ""And if I ever catch you leaving a mess again, you're going straight to Lab 3 for dissection. Got it? That's Dr. Hendricks' lab. Man names his scalpels.""

""G-O-T-I-T,"" the entity spelled quickly, forming the letters with such enthusiasm that they nearly glowed in the dark.

""Good. Now get. And for God's sake, stay out of the cafeteria. After that incident with the living gelatin mold, the lunch lady's got a flamethrower."" Ellis opened the lid a bit wider, and the entity slithered out, quickly disappearing under a nearby door with a grateful wiggle.

As it made its way toward the promised sanctuary, skirting carefully along baseboards and leaving absolutely no trail, it heard Ellis mutter to himself: ""I really need to update my resume. 'Can handle interdimensional entities' has got to be worth something in the private sector. Maybe Disney's haunted mansion is hiring.""

The entity that would never be ""Sample 117-C"" continued its journey through the shadowed corridors of Miskatonic Research Complex, leaving no trail behind, moving with newfound purpose. Perhaps there were worse fates than coexistence with these strange human creatures. Especially ones like Ellis, who seemed to understand that sometimes, the most eldritch things just needed a little space to be themselves.

It made a mental note to occasionally help clean up some of the more stubborn stains in the east wing. After all, a deal was a deal.

And maybe, just maybe, it would leave a small gift by Ellis's cart now and then. Nothing fancy—just the occasional solution to a previously unsolvable mathematical equation, or maybe predictions about next week's lottery numbers. The small tokens of appreciation that any sentient cosmic anomaly might offer its unlikely ally in the great, weird ecosystem of Miskatonic Research Complex.",custodial matters miskatonic research

1k5nrf7,HFY,The Human Artificial Hivemind Part 592: War Council,"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/rtrcwb/the_human_artificial_hivemind_part_1_malfunction/) [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1k0b8rd/the_human_artificial_hivemind_part_591_the_waves/) [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_human_artificial_hivemind#wiki_the_human_artificial_hivemind)

Progenitor Maya slipped in a few beams to the back, propelling Penny forward, barely even causing gashes in her armor. When Penny reached the Progenitor, the first thing to go was the mindscape. Layers fractured and shattered as the two Progenitors dueled at almost twice the speed of light, breaking the law of reality in a place where it wasn't so ironclad.

Nevertheless, mental attacks were still flying all over the place. As the mindscape's shards entered real space, Penny sent mental attacks through spacetime itself with blurring hands and gleaming streaks. Maya pushed back, pulling a shattered piece of the mindscape into herself to defend, compressing it into a massive and freezing ball around her defenses.

As Penny pulled back, Maya shot out from the ball, grinning madly, her arms outstretched. Blue ice streamed from her claws, falling into the void and creating brilliant arcs that broke apart into thousands of flying swords, flooding into the front of her form and making an arrowhead.

The titanic impact tore straight into Penny's outer domain, barely even slowing down... and suddenly Maya was teleporting all over the place. Needles of antimatter sliced at her from every direction, and hulking pieces of the mindscape fell into the dense psychic energy waves lashing between the two.

Portals bloomed from all across Penny's domain, forming their own paths that aimed to cut the rival Progenitor on the very edges of spacetime itself. The millions of tiny portals failed to dice Maya apart, and the whole Progenitor's skin was riddled with miniature craters from the violence of the attack. The ice swords crashed with Penny's fists, which pummeled the Progenitor tens of thousands of times every second before passing into portals to hit her again.

""Rah!"" Maya cried out, her voice carrying waves of reality tinted with absolute stillness, her own domain smashing forward and out around her, severing Penny's hold on her trajectory. Maya's speed went from approaching that of light to an instant stop, and a thick pulse of waste heat became a white gamma ray that blew off Penny's entire lower half.

The tiny scratches on the Progenitor's skin healed instantly, as did Penny's wounds, and Maya went back in, with reality shattering once more. Normally, a smaller battle would shatter reality once, but no more rule said it couldn't shatter again.

Maya ripped open a gaping wound in spacetime, and speeding space entities poured out. Penny simply flew through them, the entities immolating on her domain like they were of the opposite matter type. Twilight felt something descend. Light started to bend around the two battling Progenitors and only continued to redshift and blueshift as the two increased the pace of their battle.

Maya roared out, forcing her domain to weave into reality more deeply and cause a change.

Space froze. Penny's momentum instantly disappeared, and the human looked disquieted before smiling. Conceptual energy flared, and the symbol on her head flashed, sending a nova of pure negative energy out into reality, destroying Maya's conceptual hold and the local reality alongside it. The reality waves surging around them started to change shape, their crests and troughs being pulled back to crash against the Progenitors.

To Twilight's eyes, the battle looked almost like a mundane struggle, mainly because of the lack of surroundings to showcase the scale. With everyone just floating in the void of space, titanic continent-destroying attacks looked just like another flash of light.

The Progenitor moved to attack Penny again, splitting into over fifty different avatars, each carrying large waves of power in their claws. They ran in reality itself, taking fallen fragments of the mindscape and throwing them at the human. Three of the shards managed to hit her, detonating and destroying her legs momentarily before they regenerated.

Twilight wondered how much psychic energy Penny had managed to store up. So far, both of them had been spending it wildly to regenerate, and using conceptual energy to throw mountains of attacks at each other. She much preferred watching battles between fleets, if only because it didn't feel as pointless.

Maya was only here to test Penny's worthiness as a Progenitor, and it seemed that was why Nova let this happen. She wasn't making it easy, though. As time went on, and pulses started to stretch into days of time, Twilight felt increasingly glad she hadn't chosen to fight Penny directly after her ascension.

She also wondered if the human would manage to empower her species through her connection to them. If so, even the hivemind might become an actual threat to Twilight, wounded as she was right now. She kept that thought away from what she was broadcasting to the rest of the Progenitors, though. It wouldn't be good for her image if she were seen worrying about such a thing.

Penny and Maya struggled against each other, their power gradually ramping up as they attempted to counter their opponents. Now, thanks to her injury, they had left Twilight's level of power behind. Penny was more powerful than Twilight had expected. Without support, if she'd attacked the Alliance like she'd planned, she'd probably truly die.

Penny was swinging Linear Singularities the sizes of cities in her hands, sometimes turning them into whips that snaked around Maya's domain to attempt to burrow into its weak points. Maya's concepts finally flared to their true power as the Progenitor let out a bellow.

If before, the waves of reality sent out were ripples, these were planetary tides. Maya's inner domain showed itself outside her body, manifesting as a roughly spherical film that went a few hundred standard lengths from her skin on all sides. Within it, the Progenitor's form seemed diffuse and scattered.

Twilight couldn't help but commend Penny for forcing the Progenitor to such a height, though she wondered how the human would respond. Maya's domain, now mingling with both its halves, was overwhelming. It rapidly eclipsed the size of common rocky planets, approaching the limits of the gas giant range.

Its force blew Penny's domain back into a bow shock, the pressure it was exerting forcing Penny through spacetime even without movement. In Maya's domain, the only way for beings rooted in reality to move was out due to the pressure.

And there it was.

Maya's domain continued to chill the area around it. It dropped to tiny increments above absolute zero. Then it reached it. Reality around the domain tore open, unable to handle the degenerate energy state. And without reality to reject it, Maya pushed further. In the normal universe, there were no temperatures below absolute zero.

Maya made them real, and no small feat, either. The plummeting temperature reached truly terrifying extremes. In a pulse, Maya's domain was approaching a negative temperature of the same magnitude as a star's surface.

The insane destruction started to tear down Penny's domain due to its might and violence. The layers of Cardinality, Revolution, Liberation, and Humanity bubbled. Humanity itself retreated into Penny, followed by Liberation and Revolution. Somewhere in there, Twilight detected Manipulation, Determination, and even tiny slivers of Space and Sprilnav concepts.

Penny's inner domain crept out from her skin, barely covering a claw's breadth from her body. As her outer domain boiled away under Maya's power, Penny cried out, her voice shaking reality around herself. The ghostly visage of the Sprilnav known as Nilnacrawla emerged from her, extending her inner domain slightly. Nilnacrawla's claws sank into her shoulders, fusing with them.

For the first time, the concepts didn't seem to have the effectiveness that Twilight had once observed in the past. In the face of Maya's power, they weren't grasped firmly enough by the human's oddly shaped hands to really contend with her. Penny tried something new when she recognized it.

**""Superposition!""**

Cardinality flared, and reality waves shuddered free, moving through directions Twilight could only partially see. Nilnacrawla and Penny shone with glory and brilliance, and their inner domain stretched to about half Maya's extent.

Then, the two fused. Nilnacrawla's body was absorbed into Penny, who gained a Progenitor-type tail, complete with the red skin and everything. Penny spread her arms, which bore ghostly claws over her fingers. Singularities bloomed out, as did scores of twisted realities.

In Penny's two arms, since she'd lost the others, she was carrying more Linear Singularities. They were charged with Liberation and Revolution to the brim. Conceptual singularities were also within the two spears and somehow didn't destroy them.

There was an expression of effort on Penny's face, and small cracks running down from her eyes. But she heaved the spears forward.

They pushed through the burning and freezing domain of Progenitor Maya. Once they struck the inner domain, things turned upside down. The darkness became light, and a nigh-endless sense of power flooded out from the twin spears.

Maya pushed her domain down onto them, and... the spears vanished. They reappeared outside her inner domain again, traveling at nearly 80% the speed of light. Reality and its rippling waves were dragged alongside it, following the structure of a sonic boom, with heavy wave compressions near the tips of the spears only making them more destructive. They were only speeding up, imbued with some self-propagating property that accelerated them.

*Cardinality*, Twilight realized. And with the spears oddly resistant to Maya's attempts at damaging them, it seemed Penny had finally found a weapon Maya would need to contend against.

Twilight could recognize past pieces of Penny's power unified in them. The teleportation was her 'displacement' using Cardinality, as was the acceleration. The power that kept the spears in their shapes was Conceptual Humanity, which made sense considering how long they'd spent comparatively as a hunter-gatherer civilization.

The spatial effects were due to the spears' strength, while Revolution and Liberation's concepts pushed them into a more combative matchup with a rival power. Lastly, Nilnacrawla was donating a shred of the Sprilnav concept. That shred also canceled out a significant portion of Maya's ability to influence the spears because Nilnacrawla had both the age of an Elder and the power of a Progenitor.

Truly, the unity of Nilnacrawla and Penny was very dangerous and powerful. And this was with a little over a day's worth of time. How many capabilities and frontiers could Penny and Nilnacrawla explore over millions of years?

Twilight was truly glad she'd been on the sidelines. Unless Penny weakened significantly, Twilight would no longer move against her or the Alliance. The danger was simply too great, and the benefits too low.

Reality was creaking around the battling Progenitors as if in agreement with Twilight's assessment. Their planet-destroying might was simply too concentrated. Maya had formed her own set of swords in response, but they were bent by the impacts of Penny's spears and quickly made useless.

The spears were the length of continents at first. But as they grew smaller, they grew faster, hitting Maya's domain harder. They reached the point where the Progenitor couldn't attack Penny, who still had a strained look. Clearly, she was feeding the attack with her conceptual and psychic power. How long she could do so was unknown. Neither of the two had burned their lifespans yet.

Maya's domain shrank, and her eyes slowly widened as the two spears stopped teleporting around and pushed straight into her retreating domain. Maya's form shrank down, and so did Penny's.

When they reached their typical sizes, the spears were mountain-sized pillars of light.

Twilight shuddered.

White holes.

Penny had somehow flipped around the very nature of a Linear Singularity into a white hole. It wasn't an unheard-of technique. But it did cost a lot of power, which it seemed Cardinality negated.

And the spears kept getting smaller. Once they reached the length of a normal Sprilnav, Maya's domain had reached the size of a large room, encasing her in a blue aura thick enough to hide her entirely.

The spears soared at Maya's domain. They impacted it with a roiling sound of shifting reality, crawling frost shattering in the morning light from branches, and of glaciers the size of cities shattering and calving away, thick frosty layers being bent away from the perfect sphere of Maya's domain.

Twilight saw the corresponding dips in strength between the battling Progenitors. It was a shaving of a few boulders from mountains, but Maya's mountain was heavier and far larger than Penny's. Nilnacrawla helped make up the difference, the overlapping peak of his domain etching itself overtop Penny's, weaving in and out like two half-finished quilts slowly being knit into a single unified square.

Instead, it was Penny's spherical domain, with the nascent concepts that she controlled but did not fully allocate. Revolution and Liberation were not truly hers, and thus, as Penny continued to press them into the attack, trying to batter down Maya's fortress in the void, they found far less purchase than such concepts should.

Penny couldn't influence their true incarnations. That wasn't surprising, given that 'true' Revolution and Liberation were universal concepts. Penny still had half a claw in reality and thus could not change herself enough to even hold the full weight of those concepts, much less bring enough force to bear to manipulate them. Indeed, it was likely Revolution choosing to help her rather than Penny forcing the concept into submission, which would also cause Liberation to rebel.

Maya had the control she'd had millions of years ago during her last battle with Twilight. Twilight had used her power to break the Progenitor by tearing her into space and suffocating her with the power of the old darkness. Even that effort took many days and careful planning to achieve, and cost the destruction of eight moons and a lightly inhabited alien planet.

Twilight could see the many opportunities Maya had to strike back against Penny. But the Progenitor seemed adamant about matching Penny's power, adapting to her attacks, and shifting her power to account for its intricacies. Concepts sheared and strained like beams in an arcology or the central spokes of a shield world.

Maya's domain was not entirely impenetrable, though. When Nilnacrawla and Penny achieved enough overlap of their concepts, attuning their angles of attack and paths of psychic energy, their domains infused their attacks with power Maya could not fully block through brute force. Indeed, it was these rare moments, slowly becoming more common, that were keeping Maya from winning with ease.

Their rarity would likely continue to decrease until Maya had to access higher echelons of her various methods to continue to contend against Penny and Nilnacrawla. It would likely take months of fighting for the two of them to reach full synchronization, which was already incredible.

Twilight sensed that both Maya and Penny were maintaining evacuation methods, ways out of the battle either of them could utilize if they were driven into a corner. Penny's anger had, at some point, faded, and a genuine smile adorned the human's face.

There were times that she thanked Maya for the battle and others when Maya lectured her on the various duties of a Progenitor. But the intensity never decreased, and every pulse was filled with ocean-boiling powers contending with each other, heaving and sending waves of reality echoing off like beats of a drum.

And Twilight sensed it. It was the tiniest fluctuation, but there. A small bit of Penny's power disappeared and went... elsewhere. Twilight manifested several avatars, molded and altered through the night and the fears it carried, with ears the size of legs and eyes that were bulbous and swollen. Fine hairs and whiskers caught every tiny movement in the dark, and a corresponding flare-up occurred within a small group of humans in an embassy inside the Vinarii Empire's space.

Twilight scrutinized their concepts and found that their weight in reality had slightly increased. It was perhaps a ten-thousandth of the total. And then, the invisible avatar saw a more minor increase within a Breyyan diplomat tidying up his mane and an even smaller one within an Acuarfar female busy tending to her carapace with some sort of gel.

Twilight dissolved her avatar and ensured the information was kept secure from the watching Progenitors. Only Nova would know what she'd just seen.

*Now I have proper blackmail material if I need it,* Twilight thought. *A shame, but until I finish recovering, I'll need to ensure she doesn't do to me what she did to Yasihaut.*

""So. We are at war, and Penny is an official Progenitor now,"" Empress Izkrala said, sweeping her gaze across the hologram of the National Exchange. Even the wanderers were present at this meeting, having elected a new President of the Confederacy named Rez Pall.

Izkrala's information network had informed her of the likelihood of him being behind Iontona's downfall, but she didn't care. Unlike the rest of the Alliance, she felt the wanderers were only there for the wider protective umbrella rather than a genuine interest in participating. Despite her falling out with Blistanna over trying to get some Sprilnav to be more useful, at least the Guulin was still genuine and true to the Alliance itself.

She and, more importantly, the officials surrounding her could be worked with despite their opposition. The Confederacy's continued instability was yet another confirmation that Izkrala's path of monarchy was best for normal society, assuming that the ruler was a good fit. Even if Humanity didn't see it the same way and influenced its client species to deny it, reality said otherwise.

To that end, Izkrala had already set up several projects to analyze the sources of instability within the Confederacy and the rest of the Alliance to attempt to prevent such things from arising in its remaining nations and her own.

There was another addition to the National Exchange. It had been two years since the Alliance had fully defeated the Ratlatmil Republic, replacing it with the Ratlatmil Protectorate. Since then, extensive rebuilding efforts on behalf of Humanity and the Acuarfar had started. The Guulin still had problems with the remnants of the Republic due to its previous slavery policies, which had been completely abolished.

Phoebe had been required to step in to prevent complete economic collapse with that ban, and there were still intensive checks related to the war and travel privileges. Izkrala had set up several diplomatic inroads to ensure she influenced the budding nation, as had Humanity, the Guulin, the Knowers, Breyyanik, and Dreedeen.

The official status of the Protectorate would soon be decided by referendum, with each common Sevvi citizen having a say in the name they wanted. For now, their first Prime Minister was seated nearby.

Prime Minister Tarion was a prominent member of their faith organizations, even if the faith of the God Emperor had suffered a massive blow due to their loss. Due to the more patriarchal nature of Sevvi society, Izkrala had found that male leaders were both more likely to be elected and respected.

With the matriarchal nature and natural gender distribution of the Muscar and Frawdar Empires, normally, there should have been a significant cultural barrier between them. However, because there still were male leaders in the Empires, and some of them were luckily diplomats at the time she'd recognized the opportunity, she had been able to fill a few embassies with entirely male populations.

Fortunately, the faith of the God Emperor, for the most part, was a compassionate one. The religion was old enough to drive their society forward, not backward, as they so often did. Izkrala, along with her budding crop of theologians dedicated to the Sevvi, believed that it was a product of the God Emperor's personal intervention to ensure his position and that the Republic wouldn't have been mired in division and stagnant tendencies.

The Prime Minister beside her was devout, more than all the rest of the Alliance's leaders combined. She looked forward to his perspective, which would hopefully serve as a whetstone for her beliefs and mind. It was terrible to have everyone around you agreeing all the time. And to see whether her view was true, Izkrala needed to confirm the others were false.

""She is,"" Council Director Hruthi said. ""From what we can tell, the average human has become roughly 30% stronger, and 80% tougher. Babies seem to have had little changes besides the durability increase, while puberty seems to be the main divider between having the strength or not.

Adult humans are roughly 40% stronger than before, though. There's slight improvements to our nervous systems, large ones to our immune systems, and even changes in taste and eyesight in some people. As of now, it also seems that the Breyyanik are having lesser influences.""

""What is the theory?"" Izkrala asked.

""The Blood Bond,"" Frelney'Brey said. ""Whether or not that is because some universal force recognizes it as binding us to Humanity or because Penny does, we have about a tenth of the effects.""

""This is too rapid,"" Izkrala said. ""Penny has become too powerful too quickly. It will threaten the Sprilnav in the wrong ways. Phoebe, what movements have you observed as a result?""

""Penny is in a battle with another Progenitor, I suspect as a test of her capabilities. The Progenitors are the entire backbone of the political systems of the Sprilnav. Thanks to this, entire factions will be turning their eyes to us and potentially trying to capture either humans or general Alliance citizens to see if the procedure can be replicated.""

""Do we know why it has happened so quickly?""

""Based on how concepts work, it seems two main factors are likely. The first is that Penny is known for her association with Progenitor Lecalicus, and healing him from Death was an act far more massive than we think. His new sanity and strength may seem like the norm to us, but not to them. Besides the influence of Kashaunta in her own nation, it is likely that the act silently spread Penny's name to most of the Sprilnav sections of the galaxy.

The second theory is that either humans or alien species in general have a lower threshold for becoming a Progenitor. I do not believe it is very likely that the formula for Penny's success can be replicated, as both Kashaunta and I have tested its efficacy for other famous beings. For now, it seems that Penny is it.""

""What do we need to do to prepare?"" Fyuuleen asked. ""How likely is war?""

""99.99%,"" Phoebe said. ""The only reason it is not 100% is due to my natural constraints in calculating probabilities related to entire societies. Technically, the Alliance itself is not yet at war, since no ships are attacking us directly.""

""So that is why the wanderers haven't come,"" Frelney'Brey said. ""They are planning to leave.""

""We will deal with that later,"" Fyuuleen responded. ""What sorts of forces?""

""So far, nothing we can't manage. More Sprilnav, perhaps a few nations rallying to the banner of those who are trying to form a coalition against us. The Imperium hasn't joined the talks the Anti-Alliance Coalition are having about sending joint forces to deal with us. But if my estimates are correct, we will have a force at least ten times our current fleet strength marching toward us in less than a year.""

""You seem unconcerned with this,"" Prime Minister Talion said.

""I am not entirely so,"" Phoebe said. ""However, I am working on expanding our fleets rapidly, and the war games with the newer Fleet Commanders have shown incredible promise. Even without the Vinarii or Cawlarians, we can delay the battle enough for victory against conventional forces.""

""Could you explain your confidence more clearly, Phoebe?"" Dilandekar asked.

""Gladly. The first reason is organizational. It will take them significant political capital and time to establish a joint force, which will allow me to start throwing wrenches into it. And even when they do set out, we have an old tactic that works very well. We're already using it to high effect against the Sprilnav. Through Brey, we can throw FTL suppression satellites into their path, forcing them into real space. They will have to spend time to destroy the source of the disruption before heading back into speeding space.

Additionally, we have already deployed these 'mines' throughout the entire region surrounding the Alliance. While we had a moment of peace, Brey and Gaia were continually being strengthened with private psychic amplifier arrays. Through development from a fusion of my own theories, the technology of the Sprilnav and the Sevvi, I have managed to form a somewhat directional version of the amplifier.

Third, and last, is that Penny's protection is over us. Her status as a Progenitor will not just spread among the Sprilnav. Even if a Progenitor embattles her, her avatars are still present in several locations in the Alliance. They are undoubtedly stronger than before.""

""Won't that mean they will have countermeasures in place against this, then?""

""Against a Progenitor? There are very few of those, and all of them require Sprilnav Ruler backing, as far as I know,"" Phoebe said. ""Devices on that scale are simply above the technology we can access, through manufacturing or loans from the Autonomous People's Stars. Kashaunta has also deliberately crashed her economy, which is what's getting the drums of war started up.""

""Aren't you the most skilled with such predictions?"" Talion asked.

""At least a ninth of Kashaunta's wealth has faded into mid-air, whether digital or real. It has caused various stock prices related to her to drop to an all-time low, yet others are still rising, likely because a new Progenitor under her banner has emerged. We don't fully understand the cultural and political value of Progenitors yet, and that knowledge requires experience within the higher echelons of Sprilnav society.

While the lower rungs are accessible to me easily, all the higher ones are still barred to me. I don't know how the richest and most powerful Sprilnav are moving, or even what is resulting from accidental chaos versus purposeful management. As of right now, Kashaunta herself seems to be pushing us off, likely for war with other Rulers. It's a good thing since those wormholes are the only way for their fleets to quickly enter our borders.""

""And that crash will trickle down and destroy many other economies tied to the Sprilnav, and they will also seek war and perhaps the destruction of their enemies,"" Council Director Hruthi said.

""Yes.""

""How bad will it get?"" asked Conclave Leader Fyuuleen.

Phoebe showed an image of the galaxy. Then she zoomed in, showing several hundred fleet battles with massive lasers blooming between shielded lines. A planet exploded, hit by three planet crackers simultaneously. Izkrala figured that the hivemind had already prepared itself for the implied eventualities.

""Currently, about a thousandth of all stellar nations are at war, and I estimate that will rise to half in the next year. 1% of the galaxy will die.""

""At worst?""

""At best,"" Phoebe said.

The room became silent. Izkrala's simmering thoughts froze over. Phoebe looked them all in the eyes.

""According to Sprilnav history, the last Intra-Galactic War, which was the 29th, killed roughly 10% of all Sprilnav, and 86% of all regular aliens. At worst, the approaching 30th could kill at most 20% of all Sprilnav, and 100% of all alien species.""

""Truly 100%?""

""Yes,"" Phoebe replied. ""Penny's existence proves we can become a threat, and quickly. With Rulers growing wise to this possibility and backing various alien powers, they will attempt to create new Progenitors by any means necessary, and some might succeed. This possibility accounts for 2 new Progenitors appearing, and at least 4 Ruler domains, including Kashaunta's, being destroyed, with the involvement of the remaining 16. However, the past wars took over 1000 years to finish, and around 30 years on average to fully spin up. Even in the worst case, it will likely take at least a year for this new war to escalate to maximum intensity.""

""In that case,"" Izkrala said, breaking the new silence and causing all eyes in the room to turn to her. ""We need to be proactive. We reach out to all current and possible allies, and determine if they stand with or against us. If they claim to be neutral, we will merely cut them off. How should we start?""

""If they're against us, what will you do, Izkrala?"" Blistanna asked.

""Nothing, for now,"" Izkrala replied. ""We need to be defensive for as long as we can. Brey's capabilities are useful, but we should spread FTL suppression satellites as deeply as possible across the entire outer perimeter of the Alliance. Whoever has secret projects or ancient relics will reveal and use them in our defense. We must present a unified front immediately, or we will drown in this coming ocean of blood. Who is with me?""

There was silence again. Finally, Blistanna spoke.

""We have disagreed lately, Empress Izkrala,"" she said.

""We have.""

Izkrala didn't bother with more words. She knew what the moment required, and it was beneficial for her to stay silent.

""But this is beyond such things. I am willing to do what it takes to ensure we all survive. We can have unity. I will not forgive you for what you tried to do, but I am willing to set it aside for the common good of our people, as any true leader should do.""

""Agreed,"" Councilor Hruthi said. ""First, we need to determine the flow of information. What will be classified, to what levels, and how will we ensure that no Sprilnav sabotage efforts can stop us? How deeply to integrate our military strategies, how much to tell the public, everything. And whether it is those who desire truth or those who desire security, we must agree what to share. If we tell the common people what is coming, it will cause widespread panic and riots. We need to reassure them.

They know wars are starting, and are worried about them coming here. We also need to collectively determine our refugee and immigration policies. What I suggest is that we adjourn the 103rd National Exchange for now and return in two days, with full preparations to remain here for possibly several days to discuss our war preparations in detail. In the 104th Exchange, we should determine which government officials should be informed and how far the information blackout should extend. Phoebe, we will rely on you to ensure secrecy. Can you do that?""

""Unless that AI attacks, yes,"" she said. ""And I am planning for that, since Fate is real.""

""And what is my place in all this?"" Talion asked. ""I am willing to keep secrets, and I know people who are loyal who will do the same. But I also am well aware of my position. You do not see me as an equal?""

""I know why you would think that, but the war is over. I, nor Humanity, see you as lesser, Prime Minister Talion,"" Council Director Hruthi said.

""You do not have to lie.""

""I am not. The whole point of the Alliance is to rise past our grievances, and work together. I am not some racist who assumes an entire species is below me. That is not who we are.""

Council Director Hruthi sighed. ""Well. We've seen that Kachilai intends to continue his war. Other nations are watching to see how he probes our weaknesses. My fellow leaders, we are no longer a peacetime nation, and that means we must come to terms with reality as it stands today. My predecessors might have opted for peace. I, however, believe we need to strike first, or at least second.

While we cannot conquer our enemies as nations of old once did, we have similar options to those they had. Earth's history, for one, has given me a great deal of lessons on how to cripple a nation. Regime change failed us because we did it softly. What I am going to advocate is a total war, except for superweapons. I propose that we destroy the Holy Westic Empire.""

""Destroy?"" Fyuuleen asked. She gave Hruthi the equivalent of an angry look.

""Yes. Luna destroyed the old Union Movement on Earth through a combination of propaganda and carefully timed actions. Now, the United Nations remains fractured, and Earth continues to be divided, even after World War III. Nations are movements hammered into the bedrock of the status quo.

They are hard to destroy via direct force. If we invade the Westic Empire, their national identity and support for Kachilai will only grow stronger. They already have a draft and lingering wounds from Kachilai's takeover from Galshaskir. All we have to do is finish the job. Phoebe could-""

""And the refugees?""

""We are willing to provide full recovery efforts in their own nations, or to have them resettle here on Luna if they wish,"" Hruthi replied. ""We already prepared for mass refugee events quite long ago.""

""She isn't lying,"" Brey spoke up. ""Nichole helped foster the Readiness Initiative's end stages.""

""We are talking about shattering a collective culture. A species,"" Fyuuleen said.

""The alternative is invasion and war. If not by us, then by the Cawlarians,"" Izkrala retorted. ""Right now, with our aid, even with current projections of Sprilnav interference, Kachilai will lose the war. Kawtyahtnakal will lose control of his nation if he doesn't counterattack. The Wisselen are bombing the planets they can into rubble, and the Sprilnav are directly invading to slaughter all in their path personally. Do you think the Cawlarians will be nice to the Wisselen? It will be a brutal occupation, Fyuuleen, and the final outcome will be *genocide*.""

""This is terrible,"" Blistanna said.

""War often is,"" Dilandekar said. ""But we are trapped. We must grow more powerful to resist the Sprilnav. The larger our fleets grow, the more capable Penny becomes, the more other nations will see us as a rising threat. We are already a nascent hegemony, with rising control over the Vinarii Empire, the Sennes Hive Union, and the New Ascendancy, backed by Ruler Kashaunta, a figure so powerful that she features in myths a billion years old. Regardless, we will need to establish a suitable policy for this.

What will we do when waves of ships and armies come rushing to our shores, to kill and destroy if they are nice, and to glass us if they are not? All nations are built through power, whether it be the power of words or the power of violence. Our words are failing us. And remember, most of us are democratic nations. Izkrala does not need to concern herself with her people's thoughts. We do.

If public opinion sours on us, which it will if we do not strike against the Westic Empire for the genocide it is actively committing, we will be replaced. Let us not forget there are likely Sprilnav infiltrators who seek to stir the fires of rebellion and division. We shouldn't provide them additional opportunities.""

""This is it, everyone,"" Hruthi added. ""We are at a crossroads. Do we sit back and wait for the floods to swallow us, or do we help prevent our allies from killing billions more innocents after the war ends? Until we agree on this, I don't think any of us have the privilege to leave. Millions are dying every day. The least we can do is sit in our comfy virtual reality seats and talk about it.""

""To be clear, you are not advocating for the destruction of the Wisselen as a people?"" Blistanna asked.

""No. What we need to do is make sure they won't be seen as a threat by the Cawlarians, so they will survive the future. Genocidal rhetoric will gain popularity in the Hive Union with every Cawlarian killed. We are lucky that the Vinarii Empire is authoritarian, so Calanii can ignore the rage of his people to a certain extent. But before long, even their waters will start to boil. We also have to consider the eventuality of anger coming to us from the Cawlarians and Vinarii for saving the Wisselen.""

""What about demilitarization?"" Fyuuleen asked.

""In the midst of an Intra-Galactic War, that is suicide. The Wisselen will not survive that method. Even beyond our scale, there is a big picture to look at. We have to find a way to keep them alive. No plan is perfect, and I doubt we can craft a better one before the cost in lives outpaces its additional benefits.""

""Two hours,"" Fyuuleen stated. ""After that period of discussion, we can come to a decision. All in favor?""

""Those two hours could cost billions of lives. Are you prepared to pay that price?"" Dilandekar questioned.

""...One hour, then. Phoebe, can you-""

----------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Choosing the Right Cooking Method for Large Groups

When preparing hot dogs for a crowd, the key is to combine efficiency with consistent taste. You want every bite to be juicy, perfectly cooked, and ready to serve without long waits or complicated processes. There are multiple ways to cook hot dogs in bulk, and the best choice depends on the facilities available and the number of guests. Grilling, boiling, baking, and using a large skillet are all popular options, but the scalability and ease vary.

For large groups, consider methods that allow you to cook many hot dogs at once without sacrificing quality. Grilling is the classic favorite for that smoky flavor, while boiling or steaming keeps hot dogs juicy and can be done quickly using large pots. Baking in the oven offers a hands-off approach that's easy to manage when you need to prepare a big batch all at once.

### Grilling Hot Dogs: Flavor and Crowd Appeal

Grilling is often what comes to mind when you think of hot dogs at a party or outdoor event. It imparts a savory, smoky flavor that many people love. To cook hot dogs for a crowd on the grill, use a large grill grate or multiple grills if available.

- **Preheat the Grill:** Heat the grill to medium-high to get those characteristic grill marks.
- **Oil the Grates:** Lightly oil the grates to prevent sticking and tearing of the hot dog skins.
- **Arrange Hot Dogs in Rows:** Place them evenly spaced to ensure even cooking.
- **Turn Frequently:** Rotate every 2-3 minutes to cook each side evenly without burning.
- **Use Grill Baskets:** These help keep hot dogs from rolling off and simplify flipping large batches.
 
This method lets you cook dozens at once while maintaining that classic grilled flavor. Grill your hot dogs for 7-9 minutes until they are heated through and have those appetizing grill marks.

### Boiling or Steaming: Soft, Juicy Hot Dogs for a Crowd

If the goal is quick, uniform cooking without fuss, boiling or steaming is an excellent choice. Both methods keep the hot dogs moist and tender, perfect for serving a large group indoors or if outdoor grilling isn’t an option.

- **Large Stockpot:** Fill a big pot with enough water to cover all hot dogs comfortably.
- **Bringing to a Gentle Boil:** Once boiling, reduce to a simmer to avoid splitting the hot dogs.
- **Drop in Hot Dogs:** Add hot dogs carefully, and let them warm through for about 5-7 minutes.
- **Steaming Option:** Use a steamer basket above simmering water to cook hot dogs while preserving flavor and juiciness.
 
Both boiling and steaming are easy to monitor, and you can cook large batches by working in shifts or using multiple pots if needed.

### Baking Hot Dogs in the Oven: Efficient Bulk Cooking

Baking hot dogs is often overlooked but is a convenient and mess-free method for feeding a crowd indoors. The oven method lets you warm or cook nearly 50 hot dogs at once, depending on oven size.

- **Preheat Oven:** Set it to 400°F (200°C) for perfect cooking temperature.
- **Line Baking Sheets:** Use foil or parchment paper for easy cleanup.
- **Arrange Hot Dogs:** Space them roughly one inch apart so they cook evenly.
- **Cook Time:** Bake for 10-15 minutes, turning halfway through for even browning.
 
Baked hot dogs come out juicy, with slightly crisp skins depending on timing. This method also frees up your hands to prepare toppings and sides during cooking.

### Additional Tips for Preparing Hot Dogs at Scale

Besides selecting the best cooking method, a few extra tips can help you serve your crowd faster and keep everyone happy:

- **Pre-cook if Time is Tight:** You can pre-boil or bake hot dogs, then quickly finish them on the grill to add color and flavor.
- **Keep Hot Dogs Warm:** Use chafing dishes, slow cookers, or insulated containers to keep cooked hot dogs warm and ready without drying out.
- **Prepare Condiments Ahead:** Set up a topping station with mustard, ketchup, relish, onions, and cheese, so guests can customize easily.
- **Consider Bun Warming:** Warm buns in the oven or on the grill briefly to enhance the whole hot dog eating experience.
 
Planning these details helps your hot dog service run smoothly, minimizes wait times, and ensures every bite is delicious.

### Choosing the Best Method Based on Your Setting

If your crowd is outdoors and you have access to a grill, grilling offers the best flavor and social atmosphere. For indoor events or when grilling isn’t practical, boiling, steaming, or baking all let you feed many people quickly and easily.

Remember, the best way to cook hot dogs for a crowd is the one that fits your available equipment, time, and desired results. By combining these cooking strategies with organized prep and serving methods, you can keep everyone happy and well-fed with classic, tasty hot dogs.

</div>Creative Serving Ideas to Elevate Hot Dogs at Large Gatherings
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Transforming a Classic Favorite into a Crowd-Pleasing Delight

When feeding a large group, hot dogs are a go-to choice for their ease and universal appeal. However, simply serving steamed or grilled hot dogs with ketchup and mustard can feel a bit uninspired. With a little creativity, you can elevate these humble sausages into a memorable culinary experience that excites every guest. Adding inventive toppings, sides, and presentation ideas can turn an ordinary hot dog bar into the highlight of your gathering.

### Customize Your Topping Stations for Variety and Fun

One of the best ways to keep a diverse crowd satisfied is by setting up a customizable hot dog topping station. This invites everyone to build their own perfect hot dog, catering to various tastes and dietary preferences. Here's how to get started:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-hot-dogs-for-a-crowd  
  
- **Classic Toppings:** Include all the staples like diced onions, relish, sauerkraut, shredded cheddar, and jalapeños.
- **Unique Ingredients:** Elevate with unexpected items such as caramelized onions, pickled vegetables, pineapple salsa, or crispy fried shallots.
- **Condiment Variety:** Offer a range from traditional ketchup and mustard to sriracha mayo, barbecue sauce, honey mustard, and vegan spreads.
- **International Flavors:** Provide toppings inspired by global cuisines, like kimchi from Korea, guacamole from Mexico, or tzatziki from Greece to add an exotic twist.

This approach encourages guests to experiment and create combinations that excite their taste buds, making the hot dog experience truly unique for everyone.

### Consider Different Cooking Techniques to Add Flavor and Ease

The best way to cook hot dogs for a crowd often depends on balancing flavor, speed, and simplicity. Here are some creative cooking methods to consider:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-hot-dogs-for-a-crowd  
  
#### Oven-Baked Hot Dogs

Baking hot dogs on a large sheet pan in the oven is an effortless way to cook many at once. It crisps the casings slightly without needing constant attention, freeing you up to focus on other tasks. Lay the hot dogs on parchment-lined trays, bake at 400°F for 10-15 minutes, or until the skins are lightly browned.

#### Slow Cooker Warmers

A slow cooker can keep hot dogs cozy and ready to serve for an extended period, especially useful for long events. Place cooked hot dogs in the slow cooker with a splash of water or broth to keep them moist and warm on low heat. This hands-off method keeps the food hot without drying out.

#### Skillet Searing

For smaller gatherings or when you want to add a smoky char, searing hot dogs in a cast-iron skillet is ideal. The caramelization that develops enhances taste and texture, creating a restaurant-quality feel.

### Serve with Side Dishes That Complement and Impress

Pairing hot dogs with thoughtfully chosen sides can elevate the entire meal. Here are some crowd-pleasing ideas:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-hot-dogs-for-a-crowd  
  
- **Gourmet Potato Chips:** Offer chips tossed with rosemary, garlic powder, or smoked paprika for an artisanal touch.
- **Fresh Slaws:** A tangy coleslaw or crunchy cabbage slaw brightens and balances the richness of hot dogs.
- **Grilled Vegetables:** Bell peppers, zucchini, and corn on the cob bring color and smoky flavor to your spread.
- **Creative Salads:** Try pasta salad, quinoa salad with fresh herbs, or an Asian cucumber salad with sesame dressing to diversify options.

### Upgrade Serving Styles Beyond Traditional Buns

Moving beyond the regular white bun adds texture, flavor, and visual appeal. Consider these alternatives:

- **Artisan Buns:** Use pretzel buns, brioche, or whole-grain rolls for an extra dose of flavor and softness.
- **Lettuce Wraps:** Offer large romaine or iceberg leaves as a gluten-free, low-carb bun substitute.
- **Flatbread or Tortillas:** Wrap hot dogs with Mediterranean or Mexican-inspired fillings in warm flatbreads to make them handheld tacos.

1k5i2fr,SemaglutideCompound,What would you do?,"TDLR - Have unused 2.5mg monthly dose semiglutide (pre ordered 3 months, big mistake) But switched to Tirzepatide. Do I toss the semi and take the loss of money as a learning lesson, wait until my year stock of tirz is done and use semi as maintenance dose so the money I spent isn't totally wasted or add .25mg semi near the end of the week of taking tirz when it seems that I am getting more hungry again. BUD is very short and my first vials have expired at the end of last month because I dont know what to do with it. New vial I'm guessing is also short. It's arriving tomorrow. 

(Long version)
So I started out my journey with semiglutide. I started with one company for my .25mg and .50mg and then switched to another company and started my 1mg dose. I had no side effects on the 2 lower doses, but as soon as I started taking 1mg, I began to bloat. After a couple weeks, I started to get sulfer burps and severe painful bloating. No matter what I ate or did, wouldn't go away after 5 weeks from starting 1mg. So I decided to switch to Tirzepatide with a different company. 

At this one company, I ordered 1 month at first at 1mg. Thought my issues would go away with adjusting to the new dose. So I ordered 3 months supply. Bad idea. After getting my first of the 3 month supply at 1mg, I was one week into that vial and decided to switch to tirz. I also talked to the company I ordered from, and because of the lawsuit, I asked them to send me my other 2 months I paid for and close my account. They upped my dose without asking and sent me 2 months worth at 2.5mg (very short BUD) 

Well, that company is sending me another month. I dont think they realized they sent me my other 2 months worth I paid for in one shipping. They are just sending another vial and will arrive tomorrow. 

So now I will have 3 vials of 2.5mg semiglutide. The other 2 are past BUD, but I'm keeping them in a dark place in my fridge. I know many people go past the BUD with no issues. But now I'm on Tirzepatide and not sure what to do with the vials. Do I keep them for when I run out of my year long stock of Tirzepatide and use it as maintenance? Do I just throw it away? I have some people I know that are taking semiglutide but they are stocked up on compounds. One went to cheaper peptides and mixing there own. So I have no one to give it to. (I did give my 1 time used 1mg bottle to a friend, so that didn't go to waste since it was opened) I even offered at a massive discount on the 2.5mg bottles so it doesnt go to waste, but they declined as they are already stocked up for a long time. Can I mix a small .25mg weekly dose in conjuction with my Tirzepatide to get a little boost at the end of the week? I'm afraid, even with only doing .25mg, that my burps and bloating will come back. Also not sure how many units I would need to take from a 2.5mg dose/vial and break it down to .25mg dose.

I really don't want to waste $700 worth of semi compound  I paid for. (Exspensive for semi monthly,  but i was learning and finding cheaper companies in the mean time thanks to reddit) ",would,tdlr unused mg monthly dose semiglutide pre ordered months big mistake switched tirzepatide toss semi take loss money learning lesson wait year stock tirz done use semi maintenance dose money spent isnt totally wasted add mg semi near end week taking tirz seems getting hungry bud short first vials expired end last month dont know new vial im guessing also short arriving tomorrow long version started journey semiglutide started one company mg mg switched another company started mg dose side effects lower doses soon started taking mg began bloat couple weeks started get sulfer burps severe painful bloating matter ate wouldnt go away weeks starting mg decided switch tirzepatide different company one company ordered month first mg thought issues would go away adjusting new dose ordered months supply bad idea getting first month supply mg one week vial decided switch tirz also talked company ordered lawsuit asked send months paid close account upped dose without asking sent months worth mg short bud well company sending another month dont think realized sent months worth paid one shipping sending another vial arrive tomorrow vials mg semiglutide past bud im keeping dark place fridge know many people go past bud issues im tirzepatide sure vials keep run year long stock tirzepatide use maintenance throw away people know taking semiglutide stocked compounds one went cheaper peptides mixing one give give time used mg bottle friend didnt go waste since opened even offered massive discount mg bottles doesnt go waste declined already stocked long time mix small mg weekly dose conjuction tirzepatide get little boost end week im afraid even mg burps bloating come back also sure many units would need take mg dosevial break mg dose really dont want waste worth semi compound paid exspensive semi monthly learning finding cheaper companies mean time thanks reddit,1.0,,['BUD'],negative,0.9880235,negative,0.9997881054878235

1k5d6t1,DIYweddings,DIY Wedding Florals (Bud vases),"My sister's wedding was this past weekend and we DIYed all the florals except her bouquet/grooms boutonniere. I wanted to share what we did (and what we did wrong) in hopes that it will help another bride! I would have loved a post like this when we were trying to figure out what to do!

Wedding information:  
The wedding took place outside in Arizona in April. It was about 80 degrees but we were under a tent so most florals were shaded.

Florals:  
\-6 bridesmaid baskets  
\-2 vase arrangements  
\-260 bud vases  
\-3 large ground floral baskets  
\-greenery on the tent (this doesn't really count. We just cut some branches off trees at our own house)

  
One month before the wedding we placed our floral order. We did some flowers from Costco and some from Fifty Flowers. My sister was VERY particular about what flowers she wanted, so we price checked at a few online vendors, then picked two vendors that were the overall best for what we wanted.

She wanted only candles and bud vases down the center of the tables. We planned for 12 8ft tables, 18 bud vases for each table, then 45 bud vases for the 12 foot head table (but the head table had no candles).

Not sure how to best order this post, I will first go through what we planned to use, then what we DID use, and our list at the end. Hopefully that's not too confusing.

Here was my (chaotic) spreadsheet:

https://preview.redd.it/n2xcg5osffwe1.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ab4b2db7d290c4f6b66df9cdd67809f15a7d47



Floor baskets: (we don't have any photos from the photographer back yet, but I have to post while this is fresh in my mind!)

[during assembly](https://preview.redd.it/tj9pqcjj2fwe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f87fc5a67f82000bd5a4fe1f53eb80a2acae7262)

[at the entrance of the tent](https://preview.redd.it/no9ooerm2fwe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=091873dde25aeee2287a376edbf792f2f81b146a)

   \-the floor baskets were casafield from Amazon. [https://amzn.to/3EulmTA](https://amzn.to/3EulmTA) for $60, but we plan to use these in our house after the wedding. They were more oval than I expected, but we loved them! They were 3 sizes 20 inches wide, 19 in, and 17 in.  
   Using some guesstimation and ChatGPT math, we decided we would need 50 spray roses for the medium basket, 50 white stock for the large, and 50 light blue delphinium for the smallest.

Our spray roses were perfect, but the delphinium that came was much narrower than we thought, and the basket was bigger. We ended up going to Costco and buying 1 large potted hydrangea which we just placed inside the largest basket.  
We put the white stock instead in the smallest basket, and still used almost double what we had planned. Planned for 30 stems and ended up using 50.

Bridesmaid baskets:

https://preview.redd.it/zed91hz73fwe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c4df6c31c0e6dd5d06e88420a44fe0da9ff5a65

   Again using guesstimation we planned for 3 amaranthus, 3 of white stock and delphinium (2 of each and 1 of the other), 4 ranunculus and 4 anemone.  
   We ended up being pretty spot on, although we added some extra greenery pieces we had, and used about half the focal flowers we had planned, using 3-4 total instead of 8.

Bud vases:  
We planned for 260 bud vases, and wanted each to have 1 focal flower, 1 linear flower, and 1 filler flower.  
Everything sort of came together at the same time as we decided what flowers to use. They were only sold in certain quantities so we kept track of how many of each category we had. Then added as needed.  
Focal flowers: ranunculus and anemone (her favorite flower is ranunculus so we weighed that one more heavily)  
Linear flowers: delphinium, white stock  
Filler: assorted greenery from Costco, chamomile (ended up buying this from Trader Joes).

  
Vase Arrangements:  
   We had bought 2 vases for the welcome table where we wanted taller arrangements. Our plan for this was to mostly use what was leftover when we finished the other items. Our guess was: 10 stems of the assorted greenery, 11 of the linear flowers, 20 of the focal flowers.

Here was our final break down of flowers we ordered, and where I planned to use them:  
Costco:  
   \-100 assorted greenery stems (25 bells of Ireland, 25 Italian ruscus, 25 green balls, 25 eucalyptus) (10 for the vase arrangements and 90 for bud vases)  
   \-50 spray roses (all for the floor basket)

Fifty Flowers:  
   \-100 anemones  
   \-100 white stock  
   \-200 light blue delphinium  
   \-25 amaranthus

Trader Joes:  
   \-60 stems of chamomile

We chose Thursday as our delivery day for the flowers for a wedding on Saturday. When they arrive you need to fairly quickly unbox them and trim the ends and put them in water. This took much longer than we planned. About 2 hours with 5 people. Also WE NEEDED BETTER SCISSORS. I cannot stress this enough. First off, we needed more scissors, then also better ones. We finally went outside and just got the tree pruning shears because some of those stems are STIFF.  
Additionally, we needed more buckets. We had gathered 7, 5gal buckets from like home depot from people we knew. Then as we began to trim and needed more buckets we added 3 trashcans from around the house, then 2 mop buckets, 1 sous vide container, 5 vases, 1 punch bowl, and the utensil container from the counter. I mean, it worked... but it could have been better.

https://preview.redd.it/753dq7fo5fwe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f53ab483e4f3cc549caed5218d7ab40181988369

We did have more ""breakage"" than I would have thought. Maybe 10 or so ranunculus had broken heads and probably 10 or so of the delphinium were unsavable they were so squished/dry. I had not accounted for this in my plan, and would advise other people to. Also, costco did not send the bells of Ireland in the assorted greenery like the product said on their site. Instead they sent a green berry. It was important to have the bells of Ireland as a nod to my Grandfather, but we were able to pick some of these up ourselves at Trader Joes. And the Italian ruscus was much darker than we imagined, it did not match the vibe and we were unable to use any of it.

We were fortunate to have an office in our house on a separate air conditioning system. We kept all the flowers in there with the air cranked down. (Maybe not necessary if you don't live in hot Phoenix). We let the flowers rehydrate from Thursday to Friday and then Friday afternoon we had a group of friends come over to help assemble. This was also my built in plan B, because if our numbers were off and we suddenly needed to go buy more flowers, we had Friday night we could do that!

We started with the baskets, which was good because we did end up going to costco and buying the potted hydrangeas, instead of the blue delphinium. As soon as we had the baskets next to the buckets we knew it was going to use way too many stems to fill the basket and immediately changed our mind.  
We also knew it was going to take more white stock than planned, so we used what we wanted, and decided to buy more later if needed.

We started by lining the baskets with a waterproof trashbag, then soaking the floral foam in water. We layered that in the bottom then just trimmed the stems and put them in. This was actually super simple! (There are pool noodles in the photo from a hack I saw on tiktok, it did NOT work and those were promptly removed.)

While we did the floor baskets one friend did the vase arrangements and another made 1 test bridesmaid basket. Originally we were going to do these arrangements last, but decided that it would be better to have them finished, and if we needed to do only 250 bud vases instead of 260, that would be fine.

We ended up using many fewer flowers than we had planned, so this worked out well.

We did the bud vases next. At this point we knew all the flowers we had left were for the bud vases. So we could just use what we had!  
We set it up as an assembly line. First was two people who took the vases out of the box and filled them with water. Then two people who trimmed the focal flower and put that in. They handed the vase off to 3 people who were trimming the linear flowers. (Sidenote on linear flowers. Many of our linear flowers had such long buds we actually cut them in half and used them for two vases.) Then to the filler flower last.

This method worked very well for us. We had some vases that were extra small, and were fine without the filler flower. It let us keep them fairly organic.  
Finished vases went in boxes we had been collecting for a month, and back into the cold office room. Bud vases took about 2 hours, the other arrangements 1 hour. We had about 10 people helping.

https://preview.redd.it/i5au3hx4dfwe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=964aa8f555f50d268678d145bd96317475d7a19d

We were able to fill all 261 bud vases, but I will say by the end we were using some sad looking flowers. Also keep in mind we were able to fill 2 vases for almost every 1 delphinium and we used less flowers in the arrangements. If it wasn't for that, we would have been short.

In all, doing the flowers ourselves worked out very well! Although I would have ordered a bit more if I did it again!  
Total time (not including all the research I did) was about 5 hours. We spent $75 at Trader joes, $860 from Fifty Flowers, $532 from Costco, then $50 on vases, $60 on floor baskets, and $60 on 6 bridesmaid baskets. The bud vases we also bought for around $300, but I am hoping to be able to sell these. Total was $1,937 and the florist quote we had was over $4,000. 



Here are some phone shots of the finished product!

1k5cqq8,atlanticdiscussions,A Ticking Clock on American Freedom,"It’s later than you think, but it’s not too late. By Adrienne LaFrance, The Atlantic.

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/america-trump-authoritarianism-global/682528/

Look around, take stock of where you are, and know this: Today, right now—and I mean right this second—you have the most power you’ll ever have in the current fight against authoritarianism in America. If this sounds dramatic to you, it should. Over the past five months, in many hours of many conversations with multiple people who have lived under dictators and autocrats, one message came through loud and clear: America, you are running out of time.

People sometimes call the descent into authoritarianism a “slide,” but that makes it sound gradual and gentle. Maria Ressa, the journalist who earned the Nobel Peace Prize for her attempts to save freedom of expression in the Philippines, told me that what she experienced during the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte is now, with startling speed and remarkable similarity, playing out in the United States under Donald Trump. Her country’s democratic struggles are highly instructive. And her message to me was this: Authoritarian leaders topple democracy faster than you can imagine. If you wait to speak out against them, you have already lost.

Shortly after Trump was reelected last fall, I called Ressa to ask her how she thought Americans should prepare for his return. She told me then that she worried about a failure of imagination. She knew that the speed of the destruction of institutions—one of the first steps an authoritarian takes to solidify and centralize power—would surprise people here, even those paying the closest attention. Ressa splits her time between Manila and New York, and she repeatedly warned me to be ready for everything to happen quickly. When we spoke again weeks after his inauguration, Ressa was shaken. President Trump was moving faster than even she had anticipated.

I heard something similar recently from Garry Kasparov, the Russian dissident and chess grand master. To him, the situation was obvious. America is running out of time, he told me. As Kasparov wrote recently in this magazine, “If this sounds alarmist, forgive me for not caring. Exactly 20 years ago, I retired from professional chess to help Russia resist Putin’s budding dictatorship. People were slow to grasp what was happening there too.”",ticking clock american freedom,later think late adrienne lafrance atlantic httpswwwtheatlanticcomideasarchiveamericatrumpauthoritarianismglobal look around take stock know today right nowand mean right secondyou power youll ever current fight authoritarianism america sounds dramatic past five months many hours many conversations multiple people lived dictators autocrats one message came loud clear america running time people sometimes call descent authoritarianism slide makes sound gradual gentle maria ressa journalist earned nobel peace prize attempts save freedom expression philippines told experienced presidency rodrigo duterte startling speed remarkable similarity playing united states donald trump countrys democratic struggles highly instructive message authoritarian leaders topple democracy faster imagine wait speak already lost shortly trump reelected last fall called ressa ask thought americans prepare return told worried failure imagination knew speed destruction institutionsone first steps authoritarian takes solidify centralize powerwould surprise people even paying closest attention ressa splits time manila new york repeatedly warned ready everything happen quickly spoke weeks inauguration ressa shaken president trump moving faster even anticipated heard something similar recently garry kasparov russian dissident chess grand master situation obvious america running time told kasparov wrote recently magazine sounds alarmist forgive caring exactly years ago retired professional chess help russia resist putins budding dictatorship people slow grasp happening,1.0,Politics,['BUD'],negative,0.99973077,negative,0.9988962411880493
1k5brjn,Citrus,My first successful indoor lemon graft😁,"I had a 1 year old mandarin grown from seed from a friend, and was thinking of grafting it for a while. I tried first in November, with 'scions' from some store bought mandarins with the stem on. They both dried up. After reading that it's better to graft in the active growing season, I went to the plant store in March to look for some fallen citrus stems/cuttings around the citrus section. I found a small lemon stem that looked healthy on the floor, seemed around the same thickness as my root stock, and took it home to do a cleft graft. I just did it with some kitchen plastic wrap, and a normal knife. I was absolutely stoked when I saw the first bud growing, after around 3 weeks. 

Do you have any tips for care from now on? When should i unwrap the plastic? Should i just leave it on?

1k53tky,UKBBQ,Paella: simple and great one pot cooking,"Paella Recipe Servings: 4-6  
Prep Time: 20 minutes  
Cook Time: 40 minutes  
Total Time: 1 hour

Ingredients

* Seafood:
   * 12 large shrimp (peeled, deveined, tails on)- sounds fruity, but if you can't handle the whole shrimp with armor, moustache, legs, and veins, this will be the easiest way to proceed. If you do, cook the entire thing, the head and the shell are full of flavor
   * 12 mussels (cleaned, debearded)
   * 12 clams (scrubbed)
   * 1/2 lb (225g) squid (cleaned, cut into rings)
* Meat:
   * 1/2 lb (225g) Portuguese chouriço or linguiça sausage (sliced into rounds)
   * 1 lb (450g) chicken thighs (boneless, skinless, cut into bite-sized pieces)
* Rice:
   * 1 1/2 cups (300g) short-grain rice (e.g., Bomba or Arborio, no jasmine or sticky rice, you  won't be laying bricks with this starch); wash it before using it, to get foamy starch out.
* Vegetables:
   * 1 medium onion (finely chopped); if you have green onions, that will be great, too. Shallots and French onions are also great.
   * 1 red bell pepper (diced)
   * 3 garlic cloves (minced)
   * 1 cup (150g) frozen or fresh peas; 150 grams of chopped carrots will do you good.
   * 1 large tomato (grated or finely chopped or just put the whole thing; 1 tomato is the minimum, we prefer one tomato per person, chunky style, or pureed; fresh is better, canned always carries the aftertaste of citric acid.
* Liquids:
   * For those who are least experienced in cooking, use 4 cups (950ml) of seafood or chicken stock (warmed or cold). Otherwise, toss in enough tomatoes, green onions, red peppers, and carrots; that will naturally make the best stock without using pre-made stock, which is pretty gross if you think about it, to use the water of boiling chicken that has been aging on aluminum-coated packaging for months if not years.
   * 1/2 cup (120ml) dry white wine; Portugal is a country of wine, even the cheapest wine is of high quality.
   * 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
* Seasonings:
   * 1 tsp smoked paprika (pimentón; there are commonly two major types of  paprika in the market, the Hungarian kind, bitter, acid, mean and ready to feed soups for nazis, and the Spanish, sweet and sexy, sometimes smoked)
   * 1/2 tsp saffron threads (some people say to have it soaked in 2 tbsp warm water, or just toss them in the pot as is, saffron doesn't need your help to be great)
   * 1 bay leaf or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, it's sooooo good; don't crush them to make it easy to extract them when the dish is ready to serve
   * Salt and black pepper (to taste)
   * 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for heat); replace with fresh cayenne if you want to feel it coming, piri piri is king.
* Garnish:
   * We use at least 2 tbsp fresh parsley (chopped); in reality, as much as possible, until the neighbors can smell it outside.
   * Lemon wedges (for serving). Also, give the lemon a little squeeze into the pot just before you remove it from the stove or oven, give it one turn, and let the acid brighten up your day.

Equipment

* 15-inch (38cm) paella pan or wide, shallow skillet; if a paella copper pan, be careful with the temperature, too hot, and your dish will be copper-enriched, per se.
* Wooden spoon
* Stove (or outdoor grill for traditional cooking)

Instructions

1. Prepare Ingredients:
   * Clean seafood: Scrub clams and mussels, remove beards from mussels, and soak clams in salted water for 20 minutes to purge sand. Rinse squid and shrimp.
2. Cook Meat:
   * Heat olive oil in the paella pan over medium heat.
   * Add chouriço slices and cook for 2-3 minutes until lightly browned. Remove and set aside.
   * Season chicken with salt and pepper, then cook in the same pan for 5-6 minutes until golden. Remove and set aside with chouriço.
3. Sauté Aromatics:
   * In the same pan, add onion, red bell pepper, and garlic. Sauté for 4-5 minutes until softened.
   * Stir in grated tomato and cook for 2 minutes until it reduces slightly.
4. Toast Rice and Spices:
   * Add rice to the pan, stirring to coat with oil and vegetables for 1-2 minutes.
   * Sprinkle in smoked paprika, saffron (with soaking water), bay leaf, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir to combine.
5. Add Liquids:
   * Pour in white wine and let it simmer for 1 minute to reduce.
   * Add warm stock, stirring gently to distribute ingredients evenly. Taste and adjust salt (stock may already be salty).
   * Arrange chicken and chouriço back in the pan.
6. Cook Rice Base:
   * Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes without stirring, allowing the rice to absorb the stock. A crust (socarrat) may form on the bottom—don’t scrape it yet.
7. Add Seafood:
   * Nestle or go brutalist and dump all the shrimp, squid, clams, and mussels (hinge-side down) into the rice. Sprinkle peas over the top.
   * Cook for 8-10 minutes until the shrimp are pink, the squid is tender, and the clams/mussels open (discard any that don’t open).
   * If the rice looks dry but isn’t tender, add 1/4 cup warm water and cook 2-3 more minutes; a splash of white wine will be a great touch.
8. Rest and Serve:
   * Remove from heat, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest for 5 minutes to finish steaming.
   * Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing.

Serving Suggestions

* Presentation: Serve directly from the paella pan for a rustic, communal vibe to feel like a wild Latino, even if you are in the middle of Indiana watching corn grow.
* Pairings: Offer a crisp Portuguese Vinho Verde or sparkling water with lemon. Whatever the choice of drink, make sure it's not a glass of milk; that's awful. A side of crusty bread or a green salad with olive oil dressing complements the dish.

Tips for Success

* Rice Texture: Aim for al dente rice, meaning, don't boil it until it disintegrates.
* Seafood Quality: For authentic flavor, use fresh or high-quality frozen seafood. Check mussels/clams for freshness (closed or slightly open, no cracks).
* Pan Size: A wide, shallow pan ensures even cooking. If using a smaller skillet, reduce the ingredients proportionally to avoid soggy rice.
* Saffron Substitute: If saffron is unavailable or so overpriced at your Whole Foods that you'll need a second mortgage, use 1/2 tsp turmeric for color and pretend you've been to Morocco. The flavor will differ a lot; promise yourself that one day you'll get the real thing because you deserve it.

Nutritional Info (Per Serving, Approx.)

* Calories: 550-600 kcal, who cares when it's soooo gooooood
* Protein: 35g
* Fat: 20g
* Carbohydrates: 55g
* Salt: Vary (adjust salt based on whether you had to use premade stock because you felt so unsure about your cooking skills and taste buds); do not use Morton Salt under any circumstances for the sake of humanity and your blood pressure. Suppose you have it at home, trash that criminally awful subpar stuff; get yourself Portuguese Atlantic salt, or even better, Celtic Salt full of minerals; be careful with Pink salt purportedly from the Himalayas, which comes in variable degrees of cleanliness, when ground you have no idea how much dirt it has. Hawaian salt is also a good choice (the orange type).

1jujuu1,TickerTalkByLiam,"Under the Radar, Over the Bar: MYNZ’s Breakout Potential with FDA Approval","Even though MYNZ is seen as a discount stock at the moment, its technology tells a very different story.

* Its advanced adenoma detection rate currently stands at 88%, while competitors like Exact Sciences and Guardant Health trail at 42% and 20%, respectively.

1j6k2es,wallstreetbetsGER,Schlafende Cash-Maschinen: Ukraine-Frieden = Moon-Time.,"Hey, ihr! Während alle auf die nächste $GME-Rakete oder $penny-stock-Hype-Welle glotzen, schlafen die echten Gewinne direkt vor unserer Nase. Der Ukraine-Konflikt ist irgendwann vorbei – und am Ende schneller als erwartet. Vielleicht nächste Woche, vielleicht in ein Paar Jahren, aber wenn die Friedensglocken läuten, explodieren bestimmte Aktien schneller als eure Calls bei Tonner oder euter. Die Sache ist: Wenn’s soweit ist, seid ihr entweder die Genies mit vollen Taschen oder die Deppen, die FOMO kaufen, während wir anderen die Gewinne einsacken. Deshalb: Jetzt die Samen säen, bevor die Masse angreift!

Hier sind ein paar „schlafende“ Aktien mit Beta < 1 (wenig Drama, viel Potenzial), die nach dem Krieg abgehen könnten. Low-key jetzt, aber ready to moon, wenn die Ukraine-Party startet:

Heidelberg Materials ($HEI, Beta ~0,85) – Zementkönige aus Deutschland. Wiederaufbau der Ukraine? Die Weltbank sagt 500+ Mrd. USD. Wer liefert den Beton? Diese Jungs. Langweilig, aber Häuser werden nach oben gebaut.

MVinci ($VCISY, Beta ~0,70) – Französische Bau-Bosse. Straßen, Brücken, alles, was die Ukraine braucht. Stabil wie Mutti’s Rentenfonds, aber mit Raketentreibstoff für später.

TotalEnergies ($TTE, Beta ~0,80) – Öl und Gas, Baby. Wenn die Pipelines wieder laufen und die Preise normal sind, steigt das Ding. Französische Dividenden inklusive.

K+S ($KPLUY, Beta ~0,65) – Düngemittel aus Deutschland. Ukraine = Kornkammer Europas. Frieden = Getreide-Boom = K+S 

MHP ($MHPCY, Beta ~0,90) – Ukrainischer Hühnchen-Kaiser. Krieg vorbei, Export läuft – das Ding könnte 10x machen, aber spekulativ as fuck.

Raiffeisen Bank Int. ($RAIFY, Beta ~0,75) – Osteuropa-Bank. Wiederaufbau-Kredite und EU-Gelder? Die kassieren mit.

Nestlé ($NSRGY, Beta ~0,40) – Schokolade und Kaffee für alle. Defensiv, aber profitiert von wachsendem Konsum, wenn Europa aufatmet.

Warum jetzt? Diese Aktien sind jetzt noch „schlafend“ – keiner denkt dran, während Putin und Co. die Schlagzeilen füllen. Aber wenn der Frieden droppt (und der Zeitpunkt wird uns kalt, wenn auch mit Freude, erwischen), sind die Gewinne weg, bevor ihr „to the moon“ schreiben könnt. Beta < 1 heißt: kein wildes Casino, sondern solide Plays mit fettem Potenzial.

DD selber machen, kein Finanzberater, bla bla. Aber überlegt mal: Wer die Samen jetzt sät, erntet später. Wer wartet, guckt dumm aus der Wäsche. Positions or ban – ich bin drin.

Edit: Das soll keine Anlageberatung sein. Bitte beachtet, dass ich ein leidenschaftlicher WSBGer-User bin und hier lediglich meine persönlichen Gedanken teile.

P.S. Danke für das positive Feedback und die Kritik!

1itc828,TickerTalkByLiam,$MYNZ – The Next Biotech Giant in Early Cancer Detection,"Mainz Biomed ($MYNZ) is not just another biotech company - it’s leading the charge in **revolutionizing colorectal cancer screening** with cutting-edge molecular diagnostics. If you’re looking for a **high-upside investment in a sector with real-world impact**, this is the one to watch.

# Why MYNZ? A Deep Dive into Its Game-Changing Tech

✔ **ColoAlert – The Future of Colorectal Cancer Screening**  
Mainz’s flagship product, **ColoAlert**, is a simple, at-home **DNA-based screening test** that detects **colorectal cancer with 99% sensitivity**. This is a massive leap forward compared to traditional stool-based tests like **Cologuard (92%) or FIT tests (\~70%)**, which frequently miss early-stage cancers.

✔ **Near-Zero False Positives**  
ColoAlert isn’t just accurate - it’s also **highly specific**, meaning **fewer false positives** compared to older detection methods. This is critical in preventing unnecessary colonoscopies, reducing healthcare costs, and improving patient experience.

✔ **DNA Buffer Technology – The Breakthrough That Changes Everything**  
One of Mainz’s **biggest recent innovations** is its new **DNA buffer system**, which extends sample stability for up to **four days**. This solves a major logistical issue in the U.S. market, where delays in shipping often degrade sample integrity. **This innovation paves the way for full-scale U.S. market entry and mass adoption.**

✔ **mRNA Biomarker Expansion – The Next Step in Cancer Detection**  
Mainz isn’t stopping at ColoAlert. The company is currently developing a **next-gen test** that will **use mRNA biomarkers** to detect **precancerous lesions with even greater precision**. If successful, this could **redefine early cancer detection**, making preventative intervention easier than ever.

  


# Institutional Confidence – The Big Money is Moving In

When **multi-billion-dollar hedge funds** make a move, smart investors take notice. **Armistice Capital**, a $7.3B fund, recently disclosed a **10% stake in MYNZ**. This isn’t a random play - they see the long-term potential in Mainz’s groundbreaking technology.

Would a fund of that size buy in for a quick flip? **Absolutely not.** They’re positioning for what’s coming next—**FDA approval, U.S. market expansion, and game-changing clinical data.**



# Pending Catalysts – The Timeline for Explosive Growth

🔥 **FDA Resubmission is Ahead of Schedule** – Mainz is pushing aggressively to bring ColoAlert to the U.S. market. Faster approval means faster revenue growth.

🔥 **eAArly DETECT 2 Study** – Large-scale clinical trials are **expanding from 2,000 to 15,000 patients**, further validating ColoAlert’s superior accuracy.

🔥 **Major Partnerships on the Horizon** – With Mainz’s breakthrough in early cancer detection, **big names like Pfizer or Moderna could be eyeing collaboration opportunities.**

🔥 **Maxim Group’s $14 Price Target – Conservative?** – Analysts have given MYNZ a **BUY rating with a $14 PT**, but with **FDA approval and full U.S. entry, $120-$160 is a realistic long-term valuation.**



# Apple vs. MYNZ – Where Do You Want Your Gains?

Sure, you can invest in **Apple** and make a few percentage points a year. Or, you can go long on **MYNZ, a company positioned to dominate the early cancer detection market, and target 10x+ gains in the coming years.**

This is a company with the potential to **change the world**. A **99% accurate, non-invasive cancer screening test** is **not just a great investment - it’s a life-saving breakthrough.**

# Final Thoughts – Are You Buying the Dip or Chasing Later?

MYNZ is trading at a **massive discount** right now, with weak hands selling into **institutional accumulation**. Every major biotech success story has had dips before the breakout.

**There’s also strong speculation that PR is dropping tomorrow.** Do you want to be in before that happens or FOMO in later at much higher prices?

The choice is yours.

1ijsolm,TickerTalkByLiam,Small cap going big - why you dont want to miss this:,"$ONEI At first, I couldn’t believe a small-cap stock like ONEI was actually partnered with Microsoft. But after digging deeper, I found the Enterprise Teams partnership confirmation. Then, it got even crazier…



✅ Multi-Billion Dollar Partners: Genesys, Five9, NICE, Cisco, and more.



✅ NYSE Uplisting in Progress:

📌 S-1 Form Filed: Dec 20, 2024

📌 S-1 Amendment: Jan 15, 2025 (meaning NYSE responded positively - otherwise, it would’ve been rejected).



Then the biggest find - a Reddit leak on an upcoming Xbox partnership. At first, I was skeptical, but after some research… IT MAKES SENSE.



✅ ONEI is already partnered with Microsoft Teams - why wouldn’t they expand into Xbox?

✅ Using VPN, I found data on Xbox’s website hinting at a new feature launch.

✅ AI & real-time multilingual voice tech would be a game-changer in live gaming.



Then today, BOOM - more Microsoft buyout buzz on OneMeta. With the AI wave (DeepSeek, AI runners) skyrocketing, this could be the perfect timing for an acquisition.



💥 PR Incoming: 

1️⃣ NYSE Uplisting Confirmation

2️⃣ Microsoft/Xbox Partnership Rumors Unfolding

1ij6acr,TickerTalkByLiam,$ONEI  - MICROSOFT BUYOUT LOADING?! 🤯🔥,"Yo… something’s up. Microsoft just might be scooping up OneMeta for their next big AI move. Y’all remember when they dropped $19.7B on Nuance $NUANU? Now, Verbum AI is out here flexing real-time multilingual AI and suddenly there’s chatter about $MSFT making moves?! 👀

🔎 Connect the dots, don’t be late:  
📌 NYSE Uplist LOADING – ONEI leveling up, institutions incoming.  
📌 Gaming + AI + Cloud?? – Xbox, Azure, Teams... it ALL fits.  
📌 MSFT NEEDS AI DOMINANCE – Google $GOOG $GOOGL & Amazon $AMZN ain’t waiting.  
📌 Enterprise AI EXPLODING – ONEI already w/ Cisco $CSCO, Genesys, Five9, $NICE.  
📌 Stock ACCUMULATING – Volume creeping, shorts STUCK.

  
if this rumor is even HALF true, ONEI ain't staying under $1.

You waiting for CNBC to tell you? Or you loading before it’s too late? 🚀🔥

Eyes 👀 $GME $FFIE $CHWY $HOLO. 💥🚨💯🤫

1ihrpvo,TickerTalkByLiam,🚨ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR SECOND CHANCE TO GET RICH?🚨,"Yo, listen up! While everyone’s hyping up NVDA and TSLA, let’s get real for a minute: big companies only give you a measly 300% growth at best. Remember, if you’d bought NVDA when it was a secret, you’d be laughing all the way to the bank - just like early Apple or Louis Vuitton. And hey, folks who snagged BTC at $200? They’re now swimming in profits!

Today’s spotlight: ONEI.

Right now, ONEI is dipping hard, and that’s your moment. This is the classic “buy and forget” opportunity ------>>> like those secret small-caps that exploded once nobody cared. We’re not chasing the hype of overblown giants; we’re talking about strong, fundamentally-backed stocks that could see 10,000% growth.

💥 Why settle for 100% or 300% gains when ONEI might just be your ticket to life-changing wealth?Invest $100 in ONEI today, and who knows what the future holds? This is the second chance you’ve been waiting for - a chance to jump in while the price is down and ride the wave when it rockets back up!

We’re on a mission:  
👉 20 million insights a day - we hit 10 million before, now let’s double it!  
👉 5 posts on ONEI and 5 on MYNZ daily - we’re not about the old GME/AMC hype, we’re in the realm of true potential.  


If you’ve ever dreamed of that “buy the dip” moment that could change your life, ONEI is calling your name!

🔥 Don’t sleep on this - FOMO is real, and opportunities like this don’t come knocking twice! 🔥

1k60p16,Options_Beginners,PEP Earnings,"PepsiCo (PEP) is a popular topic among investors, especially given its recent stock performance and dividend history. Here's a guide to understanding PEP earnings and whether it might be a good investment:

# Understanding PEP Earnings

# What is PEP?

PEP stands for PepsiCo, a global food and beverage leader known for its diverse portfolio of brands including Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Quaker, and Tropicana.

# PEP Earnings and Dividends

* **Dividend Yield**: PepsiCo has a strong track record of paying dividends, recently increasing its annual dividend by 5% to $5.69 per share, marking its 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases. [""Congratulations to all PEP investors for your annual raise!""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1ihga99/pepsico_pep_announces_a_5_annual_dividend/)
* **Free Cash Flow**: There are concerns about the sustainability of PepsiCo's dividend, as it consumed 95% of its free cash flow last year. [""Pepsi's 3% dividend yield consumed a staggering 95% of its free cash flow last year.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1g1nccs/pepsicos_3_dividend_is_95_of_its_free_cash_flow/)

# Market Sentiment and Stock Performance

# Recent Stock Performance

* **Stock Price Decline**: PepsiCo's stock has been sliding, hitting a 52-week low and even a 3-year low recently. [""PEP hit a 3-year low.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1htwdws/pep_hit_3_year_low/)
* **Market Reactions**: The stock has faced pressure due to macroeconomic challenges, competition, and regulatory issues. [""Pepsi’s stock has been sliding for a few months now, and the reasons seem pretty clear—macro challenges, competition, etc.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1i5043u/is_pepsi_stock_a_buy_now/)

# Investor Opinions

* **Long-Term Investment**: Some investors see the current dip as a buying opportunity, especially given PepsiCo's strong brand portfolio and consistent dividend payments. ""I’ve been buying all month. Not often you find 52 week lows for great businesses.""
* **Concerns**: Others are cautious, pointing out the high PE ratio, debt levels, and the impact of regulatory changes. ""The PE is pretty high, growth is not great, dividend is not high enough.""

# Key Considerations

# Pros

* **Strong Brand Portfolio**: PepsiCo owns a diverse range of popular brands, which provides some stability. ""PEP also owns Frito Lay and Quaker""
* **Dividend History**: Consistent dividend increases make it attractive for income-focused investors. [""PepsiCo (PEP) announces a 5% annual dividend increase to $5.69 per share, its 53rd consecutive year""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1ihga99/pepsico_pep_announces_a_5_annual_dividend/)

# Cons

* **High Debt and Dividend Payout**: The high percentage of free cash flow used for dividends raises sustainability concerns. [""Pepsi's 3% dividend yield consumed a staggering 95% of its free cash flow last year.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1g1nccs/pepsicos_3_dividend_is_95_of_its_free_cash_flow/)
* **Regulatory and Market Challenges**: Issues like regulatory changes and competition can impact performance. ""FTC sues PepsiCo for rigging soft drink competition""

# Conclusion

PepsiCo remains a solid company with a strong dividend history, but potential investors should weigh the high dividend payout ratio and market challenges. For those looking for stability and income, it might be a good buy at current levels, but it's essential to consider the broader market context and individual financial goals.",pep earnings,pepsico pep popular topic among investors especially given recent stock performance dividend history heres guide understanding pep earnings whether might good investment understanding pep earnings pep pep stands pepsico global food beverage leader known diverse portfolio brands including pepsi fritolay gatorade quaker tropicana pep earnings dividends dividend yield pepsico strong track record paying dividends recently increasing annual dividend per share marking rd consecutive year dividend increases congratulations pep investors annual raisehttpswwwredditcomrdividendscommentsihgapepsicopepannouncesaannualdividend free cash flow concerns sustainability pepsicos dividend consumed free cash flow last year pepsis dividend yield consumed staggering free cash flow last yearhttpswwwredditcomrvalueinvestingcommentsgnccspepsicosdividendisofitsfreecashflow market sentiment stock performance recent stock performance stock price decline pepsicos stock sliding hitting week low even year low recently pep hit year lowhttpswwwredditcomrdividendscommentshtwdwspephityearlow market reactions stock faced pressure due macroeconomic challenges competition regulatory issues pepsis stock sliding months reasons seem pretty clearmacro challenges competition etchttpswwwredditcomrdividendscommentsiuispepsistockabuynow investor opinions longterm investment investors see current dip buying opportunity especially given pepsicos strong brand portfolio consistent dividend payments ive buying month often find week lows great businesses concerns others cautious pointing high pe ratio debt levels impact regulatory changes pe pretty high growth great dividend high enough key considerations pros strong brand portfolio pepsico owns diverse range popular brands provides stability pep also owns frito lay quaker dividend history consistent dividend increases make attractive incomefocused investors pepsico pep announces annual dividend increase per share rd consecutive yearhttpswwwredditcomrdividendscommentsihgapepsicopepannouncesaannualdividend cons high debt dividend payout high percentage free cash flow used dividends raises sustainability concerns pepsis dividend yield consumed staggering free cash flow last yearhttpswwwredditcomrvalueinvestingcommentsgnccspepsicosdividendisofitsfreecashflow regulatory market challenges issues like regulatory changes competition impact performance ftc sues pepsico rigging soft drink competition conclusion pepsico remains solid company strong dividend history potential investors weigh high dividend payout ratio market challenges looking stability income might good buy current levels essential consider broader market context individual financial goals,1.0,,['PEP'],negative,0.9913579,neutral,0.9999986886978149

Dom Dolla (pacing with energy):
“The luck of the draw might make or break your night — and trust me, some of these numbers are gonna make life real miserable for a few poor souls.”

(Dom rips open the envelopes one by one.)

⸻

Dom Dolla (smirking):
“Big Daddy Gayle drawing number TWO? Man’s gonna have to go from bell to bell if he wants it bad enough!
Danny Savage at number THIRTY?
Talk about lucky — last man in, fresh legs, fresh fists!”

(Crowd erupts again.)

Dom Dolla (final words, hyping it up):
“At RoughHouse Riot, it doesn’t matter WHEN you enter —
it only matters if you survive!
Let’s get this show started!”

(Dom tosses the mic with a wink as the camera pans across excited fans holding “RoughHouse or Bust!” signs.)

	•	Post-Match Promo: (Camera cuts to the entrance ramp right after the first match — Commissioner Dom Dolla steps out again, holding a second stack of envelopes.)

Dom Dolla (grinning, pacing with energy):
“Y’all thought we were DONE handing out fate?
Nah.
RoughHouse Riot’s about to get even WILDER.”

(Crowd pops.)

Dom Dolla (raising the mic):
“Tonight — we lock in SEVEN more competitors for the Women’s RoughRiot match!

(Dom starts opening envelopes with dramatic flair.)

⸻

Official Women’s RoughHouse Riot Entrants (Announced Tonight):
	•	Haley Ramon — Entry #10
	•	Kitiana — Entry #18
	•	Becca Carter — Entry #2
	•	Hexia — Entry #5
	•	Lotus FloJo — Entry #24
	•	Montana Jackson — Entry #27

⸻

Dom Dolla (grinning into the camera):
“Some ladies are hitting the fire early…
Some are swooping in late to pick the bones clean…
Either way — if you want to walk out of RoughHouse Riot, you better bring more than just luck.”

(He gives a quick salute and exits to another loud reaction.)

	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The ring was a whirlwind of chaos from the opening bell — three teams, no tags, all-out war.

Velvet Revolt brought the attitude and raw striking power, with Montana Jackson leveling Mercedes Masca early on with a devastating spinning backfist, while Lotus FloJo tangled up Americana in the corner with wild flurries of kicks. The Bombshells were high-octane chaos, with Rox flying across the ring like a missile, nailing a springboard double dropkick that stunned both Montana and Mercedes.

But the turning point came when Mercedes and Americana found their rhythm. Americana caught Rox mid-air with a tilt-a-whirl slam while Mercedes ducked a wild clothesline from Cherry Bomb and launched her into a spinebuster from Bob McGraw on the outside.

In the ring, Americana recovered just in time to break up a near fall from Lotus on Cherry Bomb — and then, with laser focus, dropped Cherry with her signature Red White & Bruised (spinning lariat) right in the center of the ring.

1… 2… 3!

Winners: Made in America

Americana rose first, fire in her eyes, as Mercedes joined her in the center. Bob McGraw stormed into the ring holding the American flag high as the crowd roared — love ‘em or hate ‘em, the stars and stripes stood tall.

     •	Storyline Impact: Made in America’s victory cements their status as a rising cornerstone of SFPW’s women’s division — not just as symbols, but as serious contenders. By cleanly pinning Cherry Bomb in the middle of a chaotic match, Americana and Mercedes Masca prove that they’re more than red-white-and-blue hype — they can hang with the division’s fastest, flashiest, and fiercest.

Key implications:
	•	Made in America gains credibility. This win wasn’t handed to them. It was earned through grit, chemistry, and power. They now have legitimate momentum heading into RoughHouse Riot, and a tag title opportunity could be within striking distance.
	•	Velvet Revolt walks away without a loss, but without a win. They showcased ferocity and individuality, but their lack of cohesion cost them in the late game. If they want to take the next step as a team, they’ll need to stop fighting like singles stars sharing space.
	•	The Bombshells take a major hit. After talking a big game about shaking up the scene, they’ve now lost back-to-back high-profile matches. Cherry Bomb eating the pin adds tension — and could lead to friction with Rox if the losses keep stacking up.

Bottom line:
Made in America just planted their flag in the division — and now everyone else has to decide whether to salute… or swing.

Match 2:
	•	Match Type: Standard 
	•	Participants: Milagro v Ricky Savage
	•	Winner(s): Milagro 
	•	Who took the pin?: Ricky Savage
     •	Title Match?: No
	•	Star Rating (Game): 4
	•	Pre-Match Promo: [Scene: Backstage at SFPW — the show is in full swing, but in a quieter hallway near the locker rooms, Ava Moreno leans casually against the wall, scrolling on her phone. DJ Moore spots her from down the hall. He straightens his jacket slightly, flashes a quick grin, and strolls over with easy confidence.]

DJ Moore (smirking, voice low and easy):
“Funny…
Ain’t even a match booked tonight, and you’re still the toughest one back here.”

(Ava looks up, one eyebrow raised, amused but interested.)

Ava Moreno (grinning):
“Smooth talker.
Tell me — you lay it on this thick for everyone, or just the lucky few?”

(DJ chuckles, leaning a shoulder against the wall next to her.)

DJ Moore (half-joking, half-serious):
“Only the ones worth it.”

(Ava laughs — a short, genuine laugh — tapping her phone against her palm.)

Ava Moreno (teasing):
“You always this bold, or is it just ‘off days’ that bring it out?”

DJ Moore (grinning wider):
“Depends.
Sometimes you gotta recognize when opportunity’s staring you right in the face.”

(A little beat — Ava leans in just slightly, a playful edge in her voice.)

Ava Moreno:
“Opportunity, huh?
You sure you can keep up with it?”

DJ Moore (locking eyes with her, confident but warm):
“Only one way to find out.”

(They hold eye contact — a subtle, charged moment — both smiling, both clearly intrigued.)

(Ava pushes off the wall, brushing past DJ just lightly enough to make him turn.)

Ava Moreno (glancing back over her shoulder, playful):
“Maybe next show…
you’ll get your shot.”

(DJ watches her walk off, shaking his head with a chuckle, the faintest glimmer of a “challenge accepted” look on his face.)

[Fade out — a new chemistry quietly sparking backstage.]


	•	Post-Match Promo: [Scene: Milagro stands in the center of the ring, breathing heavy but victorious. The crowd is rallying behind him, chanting his name. He rips the mic from the timekeeper’s table, pulling his mask tight and standing tall.]

Milagro (voice strong, filled with passion):
“Tonight… tonight was not just about beating Ricky Savage.”

(He paces slowly, every word deliberate.)

Milagro:
“It was about proving to every single person in that locker room…
every single doubter sitting in the cheap seats…
and every single fool who ever said Milagro was ‘too small,’ ‘too wild,’ ‘too reckless’ —
that heart will always beat hype!”

(Crowd cheers louder — Milagro taps his chest hard, over his heart.)

Milagro (fired up):
“You can throw your biggest hitters at me.
You can try to break me.
You can try to silence me.
But I was born from the struggle.
I was raised by the fight.
I am the dream that refuses to die!”

(He climbs the second rope, pointing out at the crowd, the energy growing with him.)

Milagro (shouting over the noise):
“You will remember my name!
Because Milagro is not a fluke.
Milagro is not a flash.
Milagro is a FORCE.”

(He throws a fist in the air as the crowd roars.)

Milagro (final, powerful words):
“This is only the beginning.
I will not stop until I climb to the top of SmashForce Pro Wrestling.
Because Milagro does not fall…
Milagro RISES!”

(Milagro drops the mic with a heavy thunk, throws both arms up, and soaks in the roar of the crowd — a star ascending before everyone’s eyes.)


	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The match kicks off hot with Ricky Savage trying to impose his strength early—muscling Milagro into the corner and unloading with stiff body blows. But Milagro ducks out, hits the ropes, and flies back with a springboard arm drag that sends Savage sprawling.

Ricky regains control with a brutal spinebuster mid-match, grounding Milagro and pounding away with wild strikes. The crowd boos as Ricky taunts, flexing over Milagro’s prone body.

But Milagro fires back—rolling through a suplex attempt into a jaw-rattling tornado DDT! The crowd roars as Milagro climbs the ropes, measuring the moment. Ricky stumbles to his feet just in time to eat a “Milagro Driver” (diving reverse hurricanrana)!

1… 2… 3!

Milagro picks up the huge win, arms raised high, standing tall over a stunned Ricky Savage. The underdog lucha warrior just scored a major victory over one-half of the brutal Ragin’ Savages—and the crowd lets him know they believe.

Message sent: you may be bigger… but you ain’t faster than a miracle.

     •	Storyline Impact: Milagro’s win over Ricky Savage isn’t just a notch on the record — it’s a statement, a launchpad, and a warning all in one. By defeating one-half of the dangerous Ragin’ Savages in singles competition, Milagro has clearly positioned himself as the next serious contender for the SFPW Intercontinental Championship.

Key Implications:
	•	Next in Line: With this win, Milagro leapfrogs several mid-card names and now sits firmly at the front of the line for an Intercontinental Title shot. His aggressive, high-flying style has turned heads — and now it’s turning the tide of the division.
	•	Momentum Shift: Milagro’s trajectory has quietly become undeniable. From crowd-pleasing underdog to calculated threat, this win shows he’s not just fast — he’s effective. The timing couldn’t be better with RoughHouse Riot looming.
	•	Savage Fallout: Ricky Savage, known for tag brutality, just took a clean L in singles action. That could strain the Ragin’ Savages’ dynamic or force them to reevaluate their grip on dominance. Meanwhile, Bronson Rage — having lost to Brighton Banks — now watches his partner stumble too. Trouble brewing?
	•	IC Division Wake-Up Call: Whoever holds the Intercontinental Title now knows what’s coming — a relentless, aerial wildcard with something to prove. Milagro has never looked more dangerous, and his next match might just be his crowning moment.

In short:
Milagro isn’t just chasing gold anymore.
He’s circling it.
And after tonight — the champ should be nervous.

Match 3:
	•	Match Type: Tag Team
	•	Participants: Tiger Clan v Dust-up Devils 
	•	Winner(s): Dust-Up Devils
	•	Who took the pin?: Tiger Clan(Count Out)
     •	Title Match?: No
	•	Star Rating (Game): 3
	•	Pre-Match Promo: (The camera cuts to a quiet hallway lit by a single overhead bulb. Brighton Banks stands center frame in his “Banks On It” ring gear, sweat still shining on his skin after a workout. There’s no hype music. No fanfare. Just focus.)

Brighton Banks (firm, steady voice):
“RoughHouse Riot.”

(He exhales, staring down the lens.)

Brighton:
“Thirty men walk in — and only one walks out with a shot that changes everything.”

(Pauses, nodding slowly.)

Brighton:
“I’m not the loudest guy in the locker room. I don’t throw chairs, I don’t need mind games, and I don’t hide behind stables or smoke and mirrors.”

(He steps forward slightly, his presence filling the frame.)

Brighton:
“But what I do?
I show up.
I grind.
And when that bell rings…
I deliver.”

(Crowd begins lightly cheering in the background.)

Brighton (smiling faintly):
“They say the Riot chews people up. That it breaks even the toughest down to the bones.
Good.
I don’t want the easy path.”

(He tilts his head, eyes locked on the camera now.)

Brighton:
“Let the others talk about legacy. Let ‘em throw their tantrums and declarations.
I’m walking into that match with one thing in mind—
winning it.”

(Beat.)

Brighton (voice low, confident):
“And if you’re betting on someone to survive the storm?
Banks on it.”

(He nods once and walks off as the SFPW logo flashes onscreen and the crowd roars.)

	•	Post-Match Promo: [Backstage — RoughHouse Riot Hype Zone]
The camera pans across the weight room, where the sound of barbells slamming and locker doors clanking provides a natural soundtrack. In the center of the frame, dressed in matching Varsity Club jackets and game faces, stand Frankie and James — The Varsity Blues.

Frankie (arms crossed, steady):
“Everybody keeps asking us if we’re scared.”
(Pauses, smirks slightly.)
“Scared of the paint. Scared of the masks. Scared of the WarPigs.”

James (laughs sharply):
“Let’s clear that up real quick — we’ve been hit harder on Friday nights under the lights than anything those two clowns can throw.”

Frankie (turning serious):
“They act like chaos makes ‘em untouchable. Like brutality is a strategy.
But chaos doesn’t win games. Execution does.”

(He steps forward, tossing a towel over his shoulder.)

Frankie:
“And we? We execute. On the mat. In the ring. In the clutch.
That’s why we were captains. That’s why we’re walking into RoughHouse Riot like it’s Homecoming.”

James (grinning):
“BLK and Warlord think paint makes ’em scary?
We’ve studied monsters in film class, boys — and guess what? They all fall in the final act.”

Frankie:
“You want to snarl and scream? Go ahead.
Because we’re not backing down, we’re stepping up. And when that bell rings…”

James:
“We’re not fighting in fear.
We’re fighting for the title.
For the team.
For the Varsity.”

(Both men bump fists with focus.)

Frankie (final words, icy calm):
“WarPigs want a riot?
Good.
We brought the pep rally.”

[They walk off side-by-side, the SFPW RoughHouse Riot logo flashing behind them like a stadium jumbotron before the screen cuts to black.]

	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The match opened hot with Tiger Clan’s signature speed and precision—Max Liger and Puma Guerrera flying around the ring with crisp dropkicks and tandem dives to the outside that had the crowd roaring. But the Dustup Devils didn’t flinch. Coyote and Wraith absorbed the storm, biding their time with heavy strikes and brute counters that slowed the match to their pace.

The turning point came late in the bout—Puma went for a springboard crossbody to the outside, but Wraith caught him mid-air and spiked him on the apron with a death valley driver. Max Liger, already dazed, tried to rally, but Coyote cut him off with a brutal boot to the face that sent him tumbling over the barricade.

Wraith rolled back into the ring as the ref began the count. Puma clawed toward the apron, trying to recover, but he was too hurt to make it in time. Max was still out cold in the crowd.

Count: 10. Match over.

The Dustup Devils didn’t celebrate—they just stared down at their fallen prey, stoic and cold as the bell rang.

     •	Storyline Impact: This isn’t the statement win Dustup Devils wanted—but it’s the one they’ll take. Victory by count-out sends a message just as clear: they don’t need to pin you to beat you. They just need to hurt you bad enough you can’t get up.

For Tiger Clan, this is a blow to their tag team momentum. The chemistry is still there—but this marks their second straight match where things slipped through the cracks. As the Road to RoughHouse Riot gets bloodier, Tiger Clan needs to rally fast… or risk becoming prey.

Meanwhile, the Dustup Devils just proved they can outlast any storm. Now, they’re looking to bring a dust storm of their own to the Riot.

Match 4:
	•	Match Type: Triple Threat
	•	Participants: Becca Carter v Rachel Valentine v Julia Sky
	•	Winner(s): Rachel Valentine 
	•	Who took the pin?: Becca Carter
     •	Title Match?: No
	•	Star Rating (Game): 4.5
	•	Pre-Match Promo: [Dark Corridor — Static-Cut Promo Package]
The screen buzzes to life in monochrome red. A single flickering lightbulb swings above. We hear heavy, almost animalistic breathing before BLK steps into frame — facepaint smeared, blood crusted at the corners of his mouth. Warlord paces behind him, dragging a length of rusted chain across the floor.

BLK (voice low, guttural):
“You ever hear pigs scream, boys?”

(Pauses. Smiles slowly.)

BLK:
“It ain’t pretty. It ain’t polished.
It’s wild. It’s real.
It’s what happens right before the slaughter.”

(Warlord steps forward now, head tilted, staring dead into the lens.)

Warlord (raspy):
“You wear your school colors like armor.
We wear our scars like sermons.”

BLK:
“Frankie. James. Varsity Blues.”
(Scoffs.)
“All that training. All those drills.
Still won’t teach you how to breathe through broken ribs.”

(Warlord slams the chain to the ground — CLANG.)

Warlord (growling):
“You talk about execution?
We perfected it in basements, in alleys, in cages.
You practiced it in pep rallies.”

BLK (stepping close, the camera now shaking slightly):
“This Saturday, you ain’t walking into a match.
You’re walking into an ambush.”

(He licks his lips slowly.)

BLK:
“We don’t wrestle.
We rupture.”

Warlord (final words, low and cold):
“RoughHouse Riot isn’t your Homecoming…
It’s your funeral.”

(They both stare into the lens in total silence, then the screen cuts out with a single, jarring squeal — like microphone feedback or something much more animalistic.)

[Static. Fade to black. WAR IS COMING.]

	•	Post-Match Promo: [SFPW RoughHouse Riot – Main Event Hype Promo | Tokyo Thunder]
Location: Rooftop gym at dusk, skyline behind him. Tokyo Thunder is training—repetitive strikes against a leather bag. His breathing is calm, methodical. The camera closes in as he finally stops, sweat dripping from his brow. He turns to face it.

Tokyo Thunder (quiet but sharp):
“Qu’Ran Cook.
The SmashForce World Heavyweight Champion.
A man forged in fire and war.”

(Pauses. Rolls his shoulders. Stares down the lens.)

“But you haven’t faced me.
Not like this.
Not when it matters most.”

(He walks toward the camera, letting the SFPW skyline fill the backdrop.)

“I don’t walk into this main event to be another notch on your belt.
I walk in as the final challenge.
The wall you can’t climb.
The storm you can’t silence.”

(He breathes in deep — his tone rising slightly.)

“Because this is not just my opportunity.
これは、すべての犠牲の証明です。
(‘This is the proof of every sacrifice I’ve made.’)

これは、日本の魂です。
(‘This is the soul of Japan.’)

これは、雷の復讐です。
(‘This is the vengeance of thunder.’)”

(He steps closer now, voice like steel.)

“Qu’Ran —
You’ve been dominant. Ruthless. A true champion.
But at RoughHouse Riot…
You’re not standing across from just another contender.
You’re standing across from Tokyo Thunder.
The man they underestimated.
The name they didn’t expect.
The end you didn’t see coming.”

(He raises one hand and slowly clenches it into a fist.)

“I am honor.
I am pain.
I am precision.”

Tokyo Thunder (final line, in Japanese):
“世界に雷を落とす時が来た。
(‘It’s time to drop thunder on the world.’)”

(He bows to the camera — then turns and begins striking the heavy bag again as the shot fades to black, the rumble of distant thunder layered beneath his hits.)

	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The match starts with an immediate spark, each woman showcasing her signature striking prowess. Rachel keeps a calculated pace, dissecting her opponents with precision. Becca Carter brings grit and agility, while Julia Sky explodes with emotion and heart, determined to prove she belongs.

Midway through the match, Becca catches Julia with a spinning heel kick, nearly securing a three-count before Rachel breaks it up with a brutal knee strike to Becca’s jaw. All three women clash in a wild sequence — Julia stuns Rachel with a rope-assisted bulldog, Becca flies in with a diving clothesline, and Rachel counters mid-air with a picture-perfect dropkick that levels both opponents.

As the crowd roars, Julia tries to rally with a fiery comeback, lighting up Rachel with quick strikes — until Rachel rolls through a sunset flip, yanks Julia into a snap DDT, and sends her crashing outside the ring.

Becca rises slowly — dazed but determined. She charges, but Rachel sidesteps, hits a spinning backfist to stun her, and hoists her up into the “Final Verdict” (double-knee facebuster). Becca hits the mat hard.

Rachel covers —
1… 2… 3!

Rachel Valentine rises with icy focus, barely celebrating. She didn’t just win — she calculated this victory. And she made sure Becca took the fall.

Winner: Rachel Valentine

     •	Storyline Impact: Rachel Valentine’s victory in this triple threat match sends a clear, cold message to the women’s division heading into RoughHouse Riot: discipline beats desperation.

Here’s how this shakes up the landscape:

Rachel Valentine: Precision Ascent
	•	This win solidifies Rachel’s status as a top-tier competitor in the women’s division, and potentially inches her closer to a world title opportunity.
	•	By pinning Becca — someone ranked higher — Rachel leapfrogs the line with execution, not noise.
	•	Her calm, calculated approach continues to separate her from the flashier or more emotional stars. She’s not here for chaos. She’s here for gold.

Becca Carter: Confidence Rattled
	•	Becca came in with momentum and ranking advantage, but getting pinned in the center of the ring is a critical blow.
	•	The respectful striker may need to reevaluate her game plan heading into RoughHouse Riot. Is her respectful approach too measured in a division that’s getting nastier by the week?
	•	This could lead to a potential rivalry with Rachel — especially if Becca believes the win was stolen with tactical timing more than true dominance.

Julia Sky: On the Rise
	•	Julia wasn’t pinned — and she hung in against two ranked veterans. That protects her status and gives her a subtle boost.
	•	The crowd continues to rally behind her perseverance, and this performance might convince fans (and management) that Julia’s ready for a spotlight singles match sooner than expected.

Big Picture:

Rachel didn’t just win — she redefined the rules of engagement. While others brawl for glory, she plans for it.
As the Riot nears, Rachel Valentine is no longer the quiet tactician on the edge of the radar —
she’s a silent threat moving straight toward the center.

Match 5:
	•	Match Type: Tag Team
	•	Participants: Los Magos v Grimm + Anderson
	•	Winner(s): Grimm + Anderson 
	•	Who took the pin?: Los Magos
     •	Title Match?: No
	•	Star Rating (Game): 4
	•	Pre-Match Promo: (Camera opens on Xander Grimm and Austin Anderson taping up in the locker room. The atmosphere is already tense — their body language says it all. Austin paces, fire in his eyes. Xander stands in place, calm but visibly annoyed.)

Austin Anderson (snapping):
“You think you’re the leader out there just ’cause you trained longer? Just ’cause you walk like some silent samurai? Get over yourself, Grimm. This isn’t a dojo — it’s SmashForce.”

Xander Grimm (coldly):
“No one said I’m the leader, Anderson. But if we’re stepping in that ring together, I expect discipline. Not tantrums. I fight to win — not to stroke my ego.”

(Austin laughs sarcastically, throwing his wrist tape to the floor.)

Austin Anderson:
“You wanna talk about ego? You act like you’ve got wrestling coded into your DNA. Like you’re above it all. Well tonight, partner, try not to stare at your reflection in the ropes while I’m out there doing the heavy lifting.”

Xander Grimm (stepping up, unflinching):
“Then don’t get in my way.”

(They’re nose to nose, the tension thick — fists clenched — until a mocking voice cuts in off-camera.)

El Mago Sr. (off-screen, taunting):
“Oooh… trouble in paradise?”

(Camera pans to Los Magos — El Mago Sr. and El Mago Jr. — walking past with cocky smirks and smug confidence.)

El Mago Jr. (chuckling):
“If you two clowns can’t even get along backstage… how do you expect to survive against actual teams out there?”

El Mago Sr.:
“Try not to embarrass yourselves out there, amigos. We’ve already got the ratings covered tonight.”

(They laugh and walk off, leaving Austin and Xander both fuming — but now, their anger seems redirected.)

Austin Anderson (gritting his teeth, finally looking at Xander):
“Let’s shut their mouths. Then we can settle ours.”

Xander Grimm (nodding once):
“Agreed.”

(Camera fades as they walk toward gorilla — fire in their veins, fists ready. The storm is coming.)


	•	Post-Match Promo: [The screen flickers to static before a sleek, cold visual fades in. Dim spotlights cut across a blacked-out training facility. Each hit of the slow, pulsating beat matches the sound of boots echoing on concrete.]

A voice begins — smooth, confident, clipped with precision.

Paragon Jay Pierce (voiceover):
“They say SFPW is the land of killers…
of monsters…
of chaos.”

[A shot of Jay Pierce’s intense eyes. He’s standing in front of a mirror, slowly wrapping his wrists with calculated precision.]

Jay:
“Well, consider me the correction.”

[Clips flash quickly: him hitting clean, clinical strikes on punching pads. A textbook suplex in a dim-lit ring. A sparring partner tapping out furiously to a triangle hold.]

Jay (coldly):
“I don’t scream. I don’t bleed for the crowd.
I don’t need a gimmick, a faction, or a mask.”

[He stands now in a locker room hallway, dressed in sharp training gear with one arm casually resting on his hip. He looks directly into the camera.]

Jay:
“I am The Paragon—the standard by which this roster will be measured.”

(Beat.)

Jay:
“And starting next week…
they’re all going to fail.”

[He smirks, but there’s no warmth to it.]

Jay (leaning forward slightly):
“You don’t need to like me.
You just need to accept what’s coming.”

[Quick flashes: the Intercontinental Title glimmering under a spotlight… a slow shot of Jay wiping his hands and walking away from a downed opponent… the word “PARAGON” slamming across the screen in bold white.]

Jay (final words):
“Perfection isn’t an aspiration.
It’s a birthright.”

[The screen goes black. A final line pulses onscreen:]

“NEXT WEEK: PARAGON JAY PIERCE ARRIVES.”
“THE ERA OF EXCUSES ENDS.”

[SFPW Logo pulses into frame. Fade out.]
	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: This one was chaos wrapped in teamwork issues.

From the start, Anderson and Grimm struggled to stay on the same page. Every blind tag between them came with side-eyes and clipped remarks, the tension brewing louder than the crowd. Anderson refused to tag out early, throwing hands like he had something to prove, while Grimm paced the apron like a caged animal.

But when the bell rang, skill took over.

Grimm finally tagged in after Anderson narrowly dodged a double team, and the Cruiserweight powerhouse exploded — darting in with sharp knees, precision strikes, and a brutal combo that left El Mago Jr. reeling. Anderson demanded a tag back, and Grimm slapped his chest with force, tagging out with venom in his glare.

Anderson hit the ring like a shotgun blast — elbowing Sr. off the apron, dodging Jr.’s lariat, and nailing a running knee to the jaw. He picked Jr. up for a suplex, but Grimm tagged himself in mid-move.

Anderson yelled. Grimm didn’t answer.

Grimm stalked Jr., spun him, and hit “The Grimm Ending” (Ripcord V-Trigger into German Suplex). Clean, vicious, final.

1… 2… 3.

Winners: Xander Grimm & Austin Anderson

Anderson stood outside the ring, staring in disbelief as Grimm took the pin — stealing the spotlight at the last second.

No post-match celebration. No handshake. Just two men standing tall in the same ring… but worlds apart.

The win? Undeniable.
The partnership? Ready to crack.

     •	Storyline Impact: This match was less about teamwork and more about territory — and both Austin Anderson and Xander Grimm just staked a claim.

Key Developments:
	•	Rising Tensions, Rising Stakes:
Anderson and Grimm won, but the tension between them only got worse. Every glare, every blind tag, every refusal to share credit signals a potential implosion on the horizon. They may be dominant, but they’re not united — and that’s dangerous for everyone… including each other.
	•	Power Hierarchy Clash:
Anderson, ranked higher, sees himself as the natural standout. Grimm, with the higher power ranking and a chip on his shoulder, isn’t playing second fiddle. This clash of pride vs. discipline is brewing into a full-on power struggle — one that could steal the spotlight at RoughHouse Riot.
	•	Los Magos Exposed:
While respected veterans, Los Magos looked outclassed. This loss might push them into desperation mode or force a reinvention — especially as younger, faster teams continue to surge past them.

Bigger Picture:

The uneasy alliance between Grimm and Anderson is reaching its limit. They proved they can win despite each other — but that might not be enough moving forward. One wants glory. The other wants control. And when RoughHouse Riot rolls around, it’s not a question of if they explode…

…it’s who throws the first punch.

(He tosses the last empty envelope to the side and steps off as the camera pans to a RoughHouse Riot graphic flashing all the announced names.)

	•	Post-Match Promo: (Camera cuts to Dom Dolla standing backstage again — a fresh stack of envelopes in one hand, the RoughHouse Riot logo blazing behind him.
He’s all business now, a little grin flashing.)

Dom Dolla (raising the mic, crowd buzzing):
“We ain’t letting the dust settle just yet, baby.”

(He shakes the envelopes dramatically.)

Dom Dolla (grinning wider):
“Seven more gladiators are officially locked into the RoughHouse Riot —
and I’ve got their numbers right here.”

(He tears them open one at a time.)

Dom Dolla (nodding confidently):

(Dom points directly into the camera.)

Dom Dolla:
“The stage is set —
the Riot is coming —
and there’s no hiding when your number gets called.”

(The screen flashes with the RoughHouse Riot logo and fades out as the crowd cheers.)


	•	Match Highlight/Key Moment: The crowd in Albuquerque is on its feet before the bell even rings — chanting “TEA-BAG-GERS!” as the echoes of history swirl through the arena. Two former tag champs. Two brothers in arms. Now, bitter rivals for gold.

The match is a masterclass in pacing and storytelling. Kick Lethal starts fast, keeping the tempo high with dazzling strikes, rope-running reversals, and near-falls off rolling lariats and springboard kicks. Henry Alexander slows things down, targeting the knees with pinpoint dropkicks and old-school grappling. He dissects Kick’s legs to neutralize the high-flying offense.

Midway through, the pace picks up again — a furious back-and-forth sees Kick land the Roundhouse Reckoning, but Henry kicks out at 2.9. Kick doesn’t hesitate — he pulls Henry up for the Killshot Driver — but Henry twists mid-air into a British Clutch Suplex right into the turnbuckles.

They’re both down.

The final minute is sheer drama.

Kick Lethal reverses The Gentleman’s Guillotine, rolls through, and goes for a flash cradle — 1… 2… no! Henry kicks out, pops to his feet, and nails the Empire Elbow dead center of the ring.

He doesn’t go for the cover.

Instead, he helps Kick Lethal to his knees — makes eye contact — and hits one final, thunderous Regal Crown Driver.

1… 2… 3.

Winner & Still Champion: Henry Alexander

After the bell, the arena goes silent.

Henry sits up first. Kick is flat on the mat, gasping, eyes fluttering. Henry doesn’t gloat. He doesn’t celebrate.

He helps Kick Lethal to his feet.

There’s a long pause…

Then they hug.

The crowd explodes — “TEA-BAG-GERS! TEA-BAG-GERS!” thunders through the arena. Henry grabs Kick’s hand and raises it high, nodding with quiet respect. Kick mouths “Thank you” and pats the title on Henry’s shoulder before backing out of the ring to give him the spotlight.

No betrayal. No cheap shots.

Just mutual respect, old wounds starting to heal, and the tease of something beloved returning.

This wasn’t just a championship defense.
It was a love letter to legacy.

     •	Storyline Impact: This wasn’t just a title match — it was a turning point in SFPW’s emotional landscape.

For Henry Alexander:
	•	The successful defense further cements his status as one of the most technically gifted and emotionally complex champions in the company. He didn’t just retain — he proved he could put on a classic without resorting to arrogance or betrayal.
	•	This match subtly rewrites his narrative. Henry isn’t just “The British Ace” anymore — he’s now seen as a champion with depth, respect, and unfinished emotional ties that resonate with fans.
	•	The sportsmanship shown post-match softens his heelish edge and teases a slow-burn face turn — or at least a moral complexity that deepens his character ahead of RoughHouse Riot.

For Kick Lethal:
	•	Though he lost, Kick walks out with elevated stock. This was his first world-class performance since the breakup of The Teabaggers, and he proved he could hang on his own. He’s no longer a forgotten tag guy — he’s a solo threat.
	•	His loss wasn’t a failure. It was a reconciliation. And now that the wounds are healing, the crowd is clearly ready for something more.
	•	The fan chants of “TEA-BAGGERS!” show there’s serious desire to see the tag team reborn — or at least revisit the bond between them.

Bigger Picture:
	•	This match sets the stage for a potential Teabaggers reunion, whether temporary or long-term. The crowd response gives SFPW a goldmine of fan investment to explore.
	•	Alternatively, it can also lead to a compelling slow-burn will-they-won’t-they tag story — maybe they reunite for a tag run… or maybe one of them eventually betrays the moment for ambition.
	•	And with Henry now having beaten his past… his future challengers are on notice. A reinvigorated Kick, a rising Joe Osborn, or an incoming wildcard from RoughHouse Riot — the Cruiserweight Division is heating up.

In short:
This wasn’t an ending — it was a reconciliation, a beginning, and a spark. The Teabaggers’ shadow now looms large over SFPW once again… and the whole division is better for it.

1k4npx3,thestallionvibe,"Navigating the $TSLA, $NVDA, and $AMZN Rollercoaster: Market Trends and Strategies","The financial markets are currently navigating a complex landscape, influenced by political rhetoric, economic policy concerns, and a broad sense of unease. This post aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current market trends, potential trading and investing signals, and actionable strategies to navigate these challenging conditions.

Market Trends and Stock Index Performance

Index Performance

The S&P 500 has seen significant volatility, with a notable drop in recent sessions, indicating bearish sentiment driven by political uncertainties and economic policy concerns. The 52-week range is 4835.04 - 6147.43, with a market day high of 5232.94 and a previous close of 5282.7.

The NASDAQ Composite has experienced a decline, reflecting broader market concerns. The tech-heavy index's performance is often a bellwether for investor sentiment in growth stocks. The 52-week range is 14784.03 - 20204.58, with a market day high of 16066.792 and a previous close of 16286.447.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has seen a sharp decline, with over 900 points lost in a single session, likely due to renewed investor worries stemming from political rhetoric and economic policy uncertainties. The 52-week range is 36611.78 - 45073.63, with a market day high of 38906.04 and a previous close of 39142.23.

Commodities and Currencies

Gold prices have been on the rise, indicating a flight to safety as investors seek refuge from market volatility. The 52-week range is 2277.6 - 3442.3, with a market day high of 3442.3 and a previous close of 3328.4.

Oil has shown some stability, but the broader market sentiment could impact future price movements. Geopolitical tensions and supply-demand dynamics will be key factors to watch. The 52-week range is 55.12 - 84.52, with a market day high of 64.42 and a previous close of 64.68.

The US Dollar has been relatively stable, but any significant shifts in monetary policy or geopolitical events could lead to volatility. The 52-week range is 97.921 - 110.18, with a market day high of 99.208 and a previous close of 99.376.

Bitcoin has seen significant volatility, reflecting its sensitivity to broader market sentiment and regulatory developments. The 52-week range is 49121.24 - 109114.88, with a market day high of 88404.57 and a previous close of 85169.61.

Overall Market Sentiment

There appears to be a general sense of unease in the market, with concerns about rising political and economic uncertainty contributing to a broad selloff in risk assets. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China are weighing on investor sentiment across various sectors. Speculations regarding who will succeed Fed Chair Powell add another layer of uncertainty.

Potential Trading and Investing Signals

Risk Aversion: The rise in gold prices and the decline in major indices suggest a shift towards risk aversion. Investors may want to consider defensive sectors or assets that typically perform well during market downturns.

Volatility: The sharp declines in major indices indicate increased market volatility. Traders might look for opportunities in options trading or other strategies that can benefit from heightened volatility.

Economic Policy Uncertainty: Political rhetoric and economic policy concerns are driving market sentiment. Investors should stay informed about any developments in this area, as they could lead to further market movements.

Sector Rotation: With growth stocks under pressure, there may be opportunities in value stocks or sectors that are less sensitive to interest rate changes and economic policy shifts.

Diversification: Given the current market conditions, diversification across asset classes and sectors could help mitigate risk. Investors might consider adding exposure to commodities, bonds, or other alternative investments.

Safe-Haven Assets: The rise in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) could indicate a flight to safety, with investors seeking to reduce risk.

Options Activity: Unusual options activity in stocks like Lululemon Athletica (LULU), and Workday (WDAY) might signal potential shifts in investor sentiment.

Short Interest: Changes in short interest for stocks like Elanco Animal Health (ELAN), Carvana (CVNA), and LTC Properties (LTC) could provide insights into market expectations.

Tariff Sensitivity: Companies with significant exposure to tariffs, particularly those reliant on Chinese imports or exports, may experience increased volatility.

Banking Consolidation: The Capital One-Discover merger could pave the way for more deals in the sector.

Fintech Disruption: Circle’s new payments network and CSI’s AI-driven AML solution highlight innovation in fintech.

Income Opportunities: Bond ETFs like Invesco BulletShares remain attractive for income-focused investors.

Regulatory Risks: Increased SEC and FTC actions could impact corporate practices and compliance costs.

AI Growth: Continued advancements in AI present opportunities but also regulatory challenges for tech giants.

Stocks and Sectors to Watch

Technology: Keep an eye on Alphabet (Google), Apple, and Meta. Alphabet appears to be viewed as more resilient in an uncertain macro environment. Watch for potential impact from investigations into Meta.

Retail: Walmart and Target are in focus due to discussions with the government regarding tariffs.

Consumer Goods: Monitor PepsiCo (PEP) due to political and tariff risks.

Financials: Financial stocks like American Express (AXP), Blackstone (BX), and Ally Financial (ALLY) experienced declines.

EV: Watch Tesla (TSLA) for production delays and Rivian (RIVN) for policy uncertainty.

Rare Earth Materials: Monitor MP Materials (MP) amid rising trade tensions.

Real Estate: LTC Properties (LTC) has seen an increase in short interest, suggesting a potentially bearish outlook from some investors.

Restaurants: Tariff pressures could reshape restaurant buildout economics, impacting companies like Wingstop (WING), Sweetgreen (SG), and Cava Group (CAVA).

Ford Motor Company (F): Watch for a potential yield trap.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A promising stock to add to watch, as its earnings have been strong and the company has a history of innovation and growth.

High Growth Momentum Stocks

Copart, Inc. (CPRT): Significant market cap. High P/E ratio suggests a premium valuation. Watch for continued growth to justify the current price.

Lantheus Holdings Inc (LNTH): Relatively lower P/E ratio compared to Copart.

Stride Inc (LRN): Relatively lower P/E ratio compared to Copart.

Bearish Sentiment and Potential Risks

TSLA (Tesla): Concerns about the company's future, including potential bankruptcy and the impact of a new CEO, are prevalent.

NVDA (Nvidia): There is a belief that the AI bubble is starting to pop, which could negatively impact NVDA's stock price.

AMZN (Amazon) & MSFT (Microsoft): Economic concerns are reflected in paused data center lease commitments and slowed build-outs.

WMT (Walmart), HD (Home Depot), LOW (Lowe's), TGT (Target): These retailers are expected to face substantial hits to their profit margins due to tariffs.

Several articles mention investigations by Pomerantz Law Firm into various companies (RH, Affirm, Xponential Fitness, Pony AI, HealthEquity, OSI Systems), which could indicate potential risks.

Actionable Strategies

Diversify Your Portfolio: Spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to mitigate risk.

Consider Defensive Sectors: Focus on sectors that are less sensitive to economic downturns, such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities.

Monitor Economic Indicators: Keep a close eye on key economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates.

Stay Informed on Policy Changes: Be aware of any changes in government policies, regulations, and trade agreements that could impact the markets.

Manage Risk: Use stop-loss orders and other risk management tools to protect your investments.

Consider Income-Generating Assets: Explore opportunities in bond ETFs and dividend-paying stocks to generate income in a volatile market.

1k4db1v,StockMarket,Your Week Ahead in Stocks: Tech Earnings On Deck,"Here are five key things to know this week:

**Last Week's Whiplash: Health Scare, Chip Chill, Tariff Talk**

Major news last week included UnitedHealth's (UNH) massive plunge on weak guidance dragging the Dow, while Eli Lilly (LLY) surged on positive drug trial news. New US export licensing rules for AI chips hit semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), and ongoing tariff uncertainty, coupled with Presidential comments regarding the Fed Chair, kept volatility elevated. Netflix (NFLX) provided a bright spot with strong earnings.

**Mega-Cap Tech Earnings Floodgates Open**

This week marks the heart of Q1 earnings season, with a heavy focus on Big Tech. Key reports include Tesla (TSLA) Tuesday; Meta (META), IBM (IBM), and Boeing (BA) Wednesday; followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Intel (INTC) on Thursday. Investors will scrutinize results and guidance, especially around AI spending, cloud growth, and impacts from the broader economic climate.

**Inflation and Growth Data Dump**

Two crucial economic reports are due: the first estimate of Q1 US GDP on Thursday, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Core PCE Price Index for March, on Friday. These releases will provide critical insights into the economy's trajectory and price pressures, heavily influencing expectations for future Federal Reserve policy. Look for potential market reactions surrounding these releases.

**Sentiment Remains Subdued Amid Uncertainty**

Despite some market resilience, overall investor sentiment remains weak, weighed down by persistent US-China trade friction, the potential economic drag from tariffs, and Fed policy uncertainty. Futures indicate a lower open this morning as markets grapple with these concerns ahead of the week's major catalysts. Watch for shifts in sentiment following earnings and economic data points.

**Busy Week Demands Investor Attention**

With numerous S&P 500 companies reporting alongside critical economic data, expect potentially significant market moves and sector rotations. Beyond tech, earnings from companies like Verizon (VZ), GE Aerospace (GE), Caterpillar (CAT), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and AbbVie (ABBV) will also offer broad economic insights. Stay informed as headlines and data could shift the narrative quickly.

1k455ox,triathlon,Race Report: 2025 Oceanside 70.3,"Hi, 
I did the 2025 Oceanside 70.3 on April 5, 2025. One of the people I did the race with wrote a race report and I liked the idea so I thought I'd write one myself. I'm no writer (engineer) and I did this in a single draft so it might be a bit rough but this was more to process my thoughts and feelings on the race than to get published in the NYT. That said, if the lessons I learned ever help anyone with their own triathlon experience I'd be thrilled. Cheers.

**History**:

35M, been doing triathlons on and off since I was ~20. Some sprints, some Olympic, two half ironmans in 2011 and 2012. Always in summer or early fall. Swam on YMCA team from 9yo, swam high school, some Master's during and after college. Have done a few Master's Postal swims, biked a few days of RAGBRAI, and have run a fair number of races including half and full marathons. Very comfortable with distance events. I had a meniscal arthroscopy in 2021 about 6 months after tearing my left meniscus in a surfing accident, and have been off-again/on-again with pain since, but it's allowed me to continue climbing, mountain biking, surfing, distance sports, so when I had a couple friends sign up I leapt at the chance to get back into triathlon.

Edit: I'm a local so I wasn't in a hotel or anything super nearby, didn't have to go through airports or road trip it. I live about 30 minutes away.

**Equipment**:

Zoot Volt (sleeveless) with Xterra cap and neoprene cap on top of that. Plain, pool-worthy reflective vanquishers.

2013 Fuji D-6 1.0, swapped aerobars, electronic shifting, everything else stock.

Asics Gel-Kayano 30's

I carry a 12oz and 20oz bottle on the bike and a 20oz on the run, all have electrolytes. I switch between brands sometimes, but today was Nuun in the 20's and Gatorade in the 12.

for calories I use Clif Blok gels, margarita totale

**Training**:

I started with a training regiment I downloaded from Hornet Juice about 14 years ago, which I'd used for the Pigman Half Ironman in Palo Iowa in 2011 and 2012. Happy to share that with folks if requested. There is a ""Recreational Triathlete"" 6-week regimen and a ""Competitive Age Group"" 4-week regimen. Given my starting point of about 4 months out, I thought I'd go for it and do the rec schedule once and the competitive schedule twice. The flaw in my plan, of course, is that I got a bad mix of cocky from previous experience and being over-committed to my work lately, which resulted in only following about 60~75% of my planned workouts. Turns out that responsibilities make it harder to be intentional with non-essentials.

**Pre-race, race day**:

One of the pieces of advice in the athlete's pre-brief was to get a pair of sandals so my feet wouldn't get cold. I hadn't done that before so I thought I'd give it a try. I found a relatively cheap pair of sandals, but they ended up blistering an open sore on my left foot even before I could hit the end of the chute. 

I put on my wetsuit at home because I've turned into a housecat since moving to California, which means I now shrivel up at the slightest hint of cold. However, rather than zip it up halfway, I zipped it up the entire way. My wetsuit is already juuuuust barely tall enough for me, so I not only had restricted airflow while driving for about 30 minutes at 4am on raceday, but I was also sweating my butt off even before I'd parked, about a mile from the event. 

We were given - GIVEN (as part of the swag we paid for) - ironman backpacks to put our clothes in. However, in my infinite wisdom I brought two handled bags - one for post-race clothes and the other with my transition stuff that I didn't want to let get cold overnight. The shuttles were all packed, so I ended up trekking about a mile and a half with these heavy bags and my shoulders were... 'warmed up' prior to the race. 

**Swim**:

Took note of my start time of 6:59.00 - made it really easy to figure out where I was! I ended up doing the swim in **34:40**, which is roughly what I was expecting. I positioned myself right between the 31-33 and 33-35 minute groups. I've been a swimmer for ~26 years and while I hadn't practiced as much as I could have for the triathlon, swimming is my strong sport and I knew I could rely on a consistent result here. 

This was easily the rowdiest swim group I've experienced in a triathlon. I've heard about getting ankles grabbed or catching an elbow and needing to establish a zone, but it's much different when it actually happens, especially if you're someone like me with an unreasonable fear of open water swimming and you think Cthulhu has finally decided to make you his thrall every time a rogue piece of seaweed even hints at washing past, god forbid it makes contact.

For training, I had also practiced a handful of times in open water, but I still found this to be extremely cold, to the point of hypothermia. I became disoriented more than once, and my (sleeveless) wetsuit kept letting water in. When I'd hit a good few strokes and relax into my natural form, I'd get another whoosh of chilling cold or have to look up and reorient towards the next buoy. I also started feeling my hammies want to cramp up later in the lap when I would lift my chest to sight forward.

Despite the difficulties, I was pleased with this time. I could have gone faster, but without a lot more training, it wouldn't have been much faster.

**Transition 1**:

The aforementioned hypothermia really hit me here. When I got out of the water, I was not able to run or even jog, as my legs were on the edge of cramping. I walked the entire time, from re-entering the chute to exiting the transition area. My fingers were so cold and my arms were shaking so hard that I couldn't get my bike sleeves onto my arms. I decided to put my backup windbreaker on and hope for the best. I continued walking to the clip in point only to remember I'd taken off my timing chip and left it back at the rack, so I walked back, got that on, and made my way out. I also stopped to use the porta-potty and left my bike leaning against the fence. I'd seen that it was windy so I angled my bike pretty well, nevertheless when I came out I saw that my treasured two-wheeler was on its side on the hard concrete by the time I came back out. Praying to the bike gods that I wouldn't get carbon fiber splinters through my face, I finally made my way out. Final transition time, **~22 minutes**.

**Bike**: 

Strangely enough the aforementioned near-cramping ended up not being an issue on the bike. I was feeling good for the vast majority of the ride, including the big hills. However, the last ~1/3 of the course the pain in my quads, back, and butt started getting so bad that I had to start giving myself pep talks out loud as throngs of other riders sped past. Finished the bike in **3:14**, they should have given me pie. I was a bit salty at the number of people flagrantly breaking the rules, like passing tons of people in the no-passing zones or very obviously drafting. Why does Ironman bother having these rules if they're not going to enforce them? I guess at the end of the day it's between people like bib #1078 and whatever triathlon gods that may be.

I had a single sleeve of 6x Clif Bloks spread evenly over the course, margarita flavor with 3x sodium, and both my water bottles (1x 12oz and 1x 20 oz) had electrolytes. I'm a sweaty boi, gotta keep the powerlytes and turbolytes high.

**Transition 2**: 

Walked this too. I wasn't competing against anyone else, and was only here to finish in one piece and have fun. I ate my Perfect Bar (chocolate chip) perhaps a bit too quickly but I didn't want to deal with a sticky wrapper. More on that soon. Nothing else special here other than someone nearly knocked me over on the way out while he was heading to the porta-potty. I guess I was taking up the entire road from the left side despite the porta-potties being on the right. When you gotta go you gotta go! Felt better on this one at a relatively zippy **7:28**.

**Run**: 

The pain of biking quickly melted away as I started using different muscles. However, I got a stomach cramp (presumably from the perfect bar in T2) about 15 minutes in and struggled with that for roughly the first 2/3 of the run. Between that and getting knee pain that alternated roughly mile-to-mile, I cruised to a solid **2:19** half marathon. I found a kick in the last half-mile which I really wish I'd taken better advantage of the rest of the race, but I guess there was something fun about the throngs of people screaming and cheering for folks wrapping up a long race.

I had a second sleeve of clif blocks distributed through this course. It was easy to time eating because there were mile markers and aid stations at nearly every mile.

Final time, **6:38**.

**Final thoughts**:

**\#1**. I was expecting to go faster overall, but in retrospect, this was hubris. Outwardly, my goal was ""under 7h"" but there was a part of me which wanted to be on par with my 23yo time of 5:23 despite training significantly less. Even so, with the pain and suffering of this race, it reminded me very clearly of the enjoyment I have doing long distance races and want to do this again next year, aiming for a better time. I can probably shave ~15 minutes off my transitions just by getting more comfortable with ocean swimming and a sleeved wetsuit, jogging from point to point, and not forgetting my chip. 

**Lesson learned**: Keep realistic expectations about what's possible and don't get cocky about what I'm capable of.

**\#2**. During my training period, I let the comfort of bed stop me from early workouts more than once, and often didn't set healthy work boundaries, preventing me from evening workouts. I think future fitness for me is going to have to address this head-on, let alone specific training goals. While I obviously beat the disqualification times, this was probably the least I could have possibly trained for the race and still finished. 

**Lesson learned**: I'm not as young as I used to be.

**\#3**. My workout regimen included two (yes, two) dress rehearsals, at T-4 weeks and T-2. A month out (full pool swim, full bike, full run, but very relaxed transitions) I did fine which lulled me into a false sense of safety and probably was why I tapered off far longer than I should have. At two weeks out (ocean swim, full bike, full run) I bonked out about halfway through the run from cramping and pain due to improper nutrition. 

**Lesson learned**: Whatever I'm used to, do that and don't change it on a big day.

**\#4**. In spite of all the negativity, pain, and soreness, I was completely fine about 3 days after the triathlon. And I would say I enjoyed the race. Triathlons have always been fun for me as I challenge myself physically, and this was especially fun seeing my friends before and during the race. Not only would I do this again, but I intend to, and I plan to improve. 

**Lesson learned**: find appreciation for the things I can do, and do the things I want. even if I think I suck at them, my passion will get me through them and give me a reason to try again next time. 

Oh, and do things with friends.

1k3xfct,u_TradingAllIn,Briefing for Monday and the upcoming week in US markets,"# Market Summary & Outlook - Week of April 21, 2025

**Overall TL;DR:**

>Markets enter the week cautious after recent tariff-induced volatility. Focus shifts to a heavy earnings slate (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META) and key economic data (Flash PMIs, GDP, PCE inflation). Ongoing US-China trade tensions and Middle East geopolitical risks remain significant background concerns, impacting oil, tech, and safe-haven assets. Fed commentary remains data-dependent amidst conflicting signals from recent economic reports.

# Weekend News Summary and Assessment (Primarily April 19-20, 2025)

**TL;DR:**

>Trade policy uncertainty persists as the major overhang, while Middle East tensions simmer, potentially impacting oil. No major new Fed signals emerged over the weekend. Congress averted an immediate shutdown, pushing funding deadlines to September.

* **Political Developments:**
   * **Trump's Tariff Policies:** Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's recent imposition of broad tariffs remains the dominant theme driving market volatility and global economic growth concerns. While some exemptions were noted previously, the overall policy stance keeps trade relations tense, particularly with China. Existing high tariffs on specific items like Chinese EVs and solar panels add to the complex trade landscape. Rumors of potential new sanctions targeting Chinese tech firms persist amid these tensions.
   * **Investor Sentiment:** The unpredictable nature of trade policy continues to foster caution, with some analyses noting reduced investor confidence in US assets and lower economic approval ratings for the administration linked to tariff impacts.
   * **Middle East Escalation:** Ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza and reported Iran-backed group activity continue. While no major weekend escalation significantly shifted oil markets pre-open, the situation remains tense, supporting oil prices and demand for safe-haven assets like gold. OPEC+ continues monitoring the situation.
   * **China-Taiwan Tensions:** Naval exercises were noted, keeping this geopolitical flashpoint relevant background noise.
   * **US Government Funding:** Congress passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) in March, funding the government through September 30, 2025. This removes the immediate threat of a shutdown but sets the stage for FY 2026 budget negotiations later this year.
* **Global Economic News:** China's Q1 GDP (reported previously) met expectations. Bank of Japan officials continue signaling potential rate normalization. Recent softer UK inflation data keeps BOE policy options open. Weaker German industrial data highlights European growth challenges.
* **US Macro News:**
   * **Inflation Data:** Last week's March CPI data showed a slight cooling (Headline 3.4%, Core 3.6%), initially boosting hopes for a Fed pause/cut. Focus now shifts intensely to this Friday's March PCE Price Index (the Fed's preferred measure) for confirmation.
   * **Retail Sales:** Weak March retail sales data (reported last week) contrasted with prior strong readings and a relatively robust labor market, adding complexity to the economic picture and softening the ""higher-for-longer"" Fed narrative for some.
   * **Fed Speakers:** No major new signals emerged over the weekend. Recent comments (Williams, Bostic, Powell last week) reiterated a ""data-dependent"" stance, acknowledging tariff impacts, showing little urgency to cut rates but also deeming further hikes unlikely *at this moment*. The Fed remains watchful of incoming data, particularly inflation.

# Last Week's Major Items and Impact on Upcoming Week

**TL;DR:**

>Tariff whiplash dominated last week, leading to lower index closes despite intra-week volatility. Mixed economic data (cooler CPI, weak retail) fuels Fed policy debate. Earnings season begins, with upcoming reports crucial for market direction.

* **Tariff Turmoil:** The primary driver was the market digesting Trump's tariff actions and China's retaliations. This volatility is expected to persist, with sensitivity to any new trade headlines.
* **Economic Data Dichotomy:** Softer CPI and weak retail sales data boosted rate cut speculation, countered by underlying wage pressures and a still-tight labor market. This week's GDP and PCE data will be critical in shaping the Fed narrative.
* **Earnings Season Kickoff:** Initial earnings were mixed. The upcoming week features a high concentration of influential reports, which will heavily dictate sector and overall market performance.
* **Market Action:** Major indices (SPY, DIA) closed lower for the week, while small caps (IWM) showed relative strength. Gold (GLD) rallied strongly, oil (USO) gained, and bonds (AGG) saw mild selling.

# Impact of Weekend News on Monday Market Open

**TL;DR:**

>Expect a cautious open. Relief from lack of major weekend shocks may be offset by ongoing trade uncertainty and anticipation of key earnings/data. Middle East tensions support oil/energy, while US-China friction pressures tech.

* Ongoing Middle East tensions likely provide continued support for oil prices (WTI, Brent) and energy stocks (XLE). Safe-haven demand for gold (XAU/USD) may persist.
* Persistent US-China trade and tech tensions could weigh on semiconductor (SMH, SOXX) and China-related stocks (KWEB, MCHI).
* Avoiding a government shutdown provides near-term stability but isn't a major bullish catalyst.
* Focus will rapidly shift to Tuesday's Flash PMIs and key earnings like TSLA. Futures (ES\_F, NQ\_F) direction pre-market will be indicative.

# Stocks, ETFs, Commodities, Futures, and Expected Impact

**TL;DR:**

>Tech earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META) are pivotal. Energy and Defense may benefit from geopolitics. Gold remains a key safe haven. Watch Treasuries react to inflation data (PCE).

* **Stocks:**
   * **Energy** (XOM, CVX, SLB, HAL, OXY, MPC, APA, DVN, FANG, COP, PSX): Potential upside from geopolitical risk premium, OPEC+ vigilance.
   * **Defense** (LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, LHX): May benefit from global tensions.
   * **Technology** (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, INTC, GOOGL, META, SMCI, AVGO, AMAT, LRCX, QCOM, ON, KLAC, TEAM, HUBS): High focus on earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META). Sensitive to US-China tensions. NVDA earnings (likely later) still cast a shadow. GOOGL also watched for antitrust news.

   * **Thematic/International** (SMH, SOXX, KWEB, MCHI, REMX, EZU): Following specific themes/regions.
   * **Bonds** (TLT, AGG, IEF, SHY): Reacting to inflation, Fed expectations, flight-to-safety.

   * **Crude Oil** (WTI, Brent, CL\_F): Supported by Middle East risk, watch inventories. Key resistance/support levels watched.
   * **Gold** (XAU/USD, GC\_F, GLD): Key safe haven; sensitive to yields, dollar (DXY), geopolitics. Holding above 2,400 is constructive. Miners (NEM, AEM, GOLD, GDX, AU) may leverage gains.
   * **Copper** (HG\_F, CPER): Global growth proxy, sensitive to China and trade.
   * **Silver** (XAG/USD, SLV): Following precious metals trend, industrial demand component.

* **Futures:**
   * **Index Futures** (ES\_F, NQ\_F, YM\_F, ESM25, NQM25): Real-time direction; watching technical levels (e.g., S&P 4,800 support mentioned previously).
   * **VIX Futures** (VX\_F): Forward volatility expectations.
   * **Treasury Futures** (ZN\_F, ZB\_F, ZNM25): Interest rate and inflation expectations.

# Crypto Summary

**TL;DR:**

>Relatively stable weekend for majors (BTC \~$84.5k-$85k). Focus may shift to potential SEC decisions on spot ETH ETFs this week.

* Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) showed minor fluctuations over the weekend. Other majors like Litecoin (LTC) and XRP (XRP) saw modest moves.
* Regulatory watch: Potential SEC updates on spot Ethereum ETFs could be a catalyst. News about Schwab's spot trading plans and potential US gov't Bitcoin reserves also percolating.
* Crypto-related stocks (COIN, MSTR, MARA) and ETFs (BITO) remain highly correlated to BTC price action.

# Legal Summary

**TL;DR:**

>Google's antitrust issues remain a focus. Broader tariff uncertainty is the main legal/political overhang. No major Supreme Court tech liability ruling expected this week.

* The Google (GOOGL) ad tech monopoly ruling continues to be relevant. Ongoing DOJ antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech (GOOGL, AMZN) persists.
* The dominant legal/political factor impacting markets remains the uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and tariffs.
* Previous major Supreme Court rulings on tech platform liability (Section 230) occurred in 2023, largely maintaining the status quo. No similar landmark decision is imminent this week.

# Highest Expected Volatility Items

**TL;DR:**

>Tech earnings (TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META), US GDP & PCE data, Fed speak (Powell Wed), and any significant tariff/geopolitical developments are the top volatility drivers.

* **Key Earnings Releases:** TSLA, GOOGL, INTC, META guidance/results.
* **US Economic Data:** Flash PMIs (Tue), Q1 GDP (Thu), PCE Inflation (Fri).
* **US Trade Policy:** Any updates on tariffs or US-China relations.
* **Fed Communications:** Powell (Wed), Waller (Mon/Thu), and other officials' comments on policy path.
* **Geopolitics:** Middle East developments impacting oil (WTI, Brent) and risk sentiment.

1k60nkb,ChartNavigators,Sector Spotlight,"The market is showing broad-based strength this week, with every major S&P 500 sector in the green. Let’s break down the top performers, highlight key trends, and spark discussion on what’s driving these moves and where investors might look next.
https://flic.kr/p/2qZoH4T



Financials (XLF) +3.31%  
Financials are leading the rally, climbing over 3% this week. Some of the top stocks driving this sector are likely major banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Consider potential catalysts like interest rate hikes and earnings reports.

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +3.16%  
This sector is also outperforming, possibly thanks to strong retail sales data and upbeat guidance from leading consumer brands. Top stocks moving this sector include Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Home Depot (HD). Growth in travel, leisure, and luxury goods could be fueling the gains.

Utilities (XLU) +2.73%  
Utilities, typically considered a defensive play, are showing surprising strength. Key players in this sector include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK), and Southern Company (SO). This could signal a flight to safety amid broader market uncertainty.

Communication Services (XLC) +2.61%  
Big tech and media names are pushing this sector higher. Top stocks in this sector include Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Verizon (VZ). Look for catalysts like strong ad revenues and streaming growth.

Energy (XLE) +2.55%  
Energy stocks continue to benefit from firm oil prices and robust demand. Major companies influencing this sector include ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP). The sector’s gains may be tied to geopolitical developments or supply constraints.

Technology (XLK) +2.44%  
Tech is keeping pace with the broader market. Top stocks in tech include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). AI momentum, chip demand, and cloud growth remain key drivers.

Materials (XLB) +2.34%  
Materials are up, possibly on the back of commodity price strength and global infrastructure spending. Key stocks include Linde (LIN), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX). Chemical producers and miners could be leading the charge.

Real Estate (XLRE) +2.04%  
Real estate is rebounding, perhaps as investors hunt for value or respond to stabilizing interest rates. Top REITs in this sector include Prologis (PLD), American Tower (AMT), and Simon Property Group (SPG). REITs in logistics, data centers, and residential sectors may be worth watching.

Health Care (XLV) +1.88%  
Health care is positive but lagging the leaders. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Pfizer (PFE) are key stocks. This could reflect mixed earnings or shifting sentiment around drug pricing and regulation.

Industrials (XLI) +1.75%  
Industrials are gaining, potentially on strong manufacturing data or infrastructure tailwinds. Major players include United Parcel Service (UPS), Caterpillar (CAT), and Boeing (BA). Aerospace, defense, and transportation stocks might be driving the sector.

Consumer Staples (XLP) +1.42%  
Staples are up, but underperforming the rest of the market. Top consumer staple stocks include Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO), and Walmart (WMT). Investors may be rotating out of defensive names as risk appetite increases.

1k5xdj0,adultingphwins,Feeling after you helps other people.,"Kanina, nasa mercury ako kasi yung partner ko nag papabili ng solution for contact lens nya. 

Naka dalawang mercury na kami dito saamin and nakapangatlo na kami sa last mercury na pinuntahan namin. 

Ang haba ng pila habang nagaantay ako ginawa ko sinipat ko na yung counter para icheck kung merong stock para di na ako mag antay. 

Habang natingin ako nakita ko si tatay, sa mercury kasi dapat meron kang hawak na number for Regular and Senior wala syang hawak i kukuha ko na sana kasi inassist na sya ng clerk sa mercury. 

Nasa likod nya lang ako kasi nga tapos na ako tumingin. Narinig ko sya na kailangan daw mabili lahat ng gamot sabi ng pharma 24 pesos isa e 10 pesos need nya. 

Pera nya is 360 lang so technically meron pa syang sukling 110 kaso sabi nya na may kailangan pa syang bilhin sa labas kaya kukulangin pera nya pero sige na daw bibilhin na kang nya yung 10pcs. 

Then tinawag na ako. Sabi ng Pharma wala na daw stock sabi ko “Sige. Kuya dito mo na lang icharge sa card ko yung binibili ni tatay na gamot ibalik mo na lang pera nga” 

Then after ibalik nung pharma yung pera himalang may last stock na available sa Sulok sa ilalim. 

Birthday ng anak ko today may extrang pera pa kaya sabi ko sa sarili ko di naman masakit yung 240 pesos. 

Para daw sa anak nya yung gamot todo pasalamat si tatay saakin. Bilang isang taong di sanay sa interaction ngumiti na lang ako sabay sibat after makuha yung card ko. 

Sana talaga mabago na systema ng healthcare sa pilipinas. Yun lang hiling ko sa lahat ng birthday ko.

1k5wvi3,adultingph,How I still manage to have 5 digit savings despite being 20k salary earner,"as title says, I'm sharing how I still manage to have 5-digit savings despite being 20k salary earner (net pay: around 18k because of mandatory contributions) 

for reference, i live alone in Manila for almost 2 years now, di po ako nagpapadala ng pera sa family sa province unless they ask me (tho super rare) kasi my parents are senior citizen with high pension. When I first started working here sa Manila, I used to live in a dorm near my workplace so I pay <3k monthly for bills (rent, utilities, laundry, internet data) with minimum wage for more than a year. I manage to save around 30k around that time kasi medyo magastos din ako nun like gala, gamit sa bahay, kaartehan, gadgets, etc. 


Few months back, I moved in a one-bedroom apartment so bumagsak talaga savings ko nun but still, I manage to have 5 digits sa savings ko pag lipat ko despite the big deposit and another stuffs I bought for my apartment. Right now, more than half of what I used to have sa savings ko kasi yung ibang gamit, recently ko lang nabili so sa savings talaga ang bawas ko. But still, we're more than halfway from were I used to be before. 

This is my current expenses per month:
Rent - P3,600
Bills (Electricity, Water, Internet) - P 1,200
Grocery + Allowance - P 6,000
total: around P11,000 rin

as you can see, wala akong pang wants which mostly kinukuha ko sa natitira sa 6k allowance ko pero month

for my savings, I save around P5,000 per month which I keep close to it if possible. Nitong nakaraan hindi umaabot ng 5k because of padala sa bahay na pa 2k or 1k minsan because pag may wants silang gamit or pagkain, ako na nagkukusa bumili kasi sila rin naggive nung panggastos ko the first month lumipat ako sa Manila na I think around 30k din kasi nag aadjust pa ako sa lifestyle ko 🤣

so how do I manage to live with P6,000 na panggastos?

Transpo: none since I live near my workplace, walking distance

load: no expiry data with no expiry calls and texts for 600 which lasts me around 3 months

food: I rarely cook. I realized based sa computation ko na mas matipid and mas healthy if bibili na lang ako sa labas everyday kaysa magluluto, wala rin akong ref so puro delata lang and instant noodles if ever. the only thing na consistent niluluto ko is Rice because 1kg lasts me 2 weeks.

for reference sa daily expenses ko sa work: P35 for breakfast, P 50 for lunch, minsan may merienda, minsan wala. sometimes i just buy biscuit na pwede i-stock sa work para may makain ako and mas matipid. but I allot P100 per day para sa food ko pero madalas di ko nako consume so may days na nasosobrahan ako. 

grocery: madalas skincare at household items lang panlinis, lysol mga ganun lang binibili ko and nag stock ako kapag sale

for weekends, since sunday lang off ko, nagdedelata na lang ako or minsan umoorder ako thru grab depende sa budget or trip ko

gumagala ka pa ba? yes po. madalas angkas pa yan papunta pauwi pero rarely lang since one day off lang ako, maglalaro na lang ako sa pc kaysa lumabas. HAHAHA

i always see myself as magastos, as I still spend kapag gusto ko, nabilhan ko pa designer bag yung nanay ko nung pasko pati ako pati bago nyang phone kaya naubos din 13 month ko at additional ipon from paluwagan before na nakuha ko 1 week before 13month pay. but still, I am proud pag nakikita kong may ganitong savings ako kasi I always think wala na akong budget pero never ako naubusan ng pera. despite being masinop, naghahanap na ako ibang work to earn more kasi nakakapagod na yung 6 days work, walang work life balance pero di naman worth it yung sahod. experience lang need ko dito sa work ko kaya lf new opportunity na tayo. 

sa katulad kong ganito kaliit sahod. wag tayo magpauto sa mga kumpanyang milyon ang net profit every month. let's look for another opportunity kasi di makakabuhay ng pamilya ang ganitong sahod!!!

edit: sa mga concern po baka maging sakitin ako kasi puro delata at instant noodles ako, weekends lang po yan and rare pa yan kasi nagoorder ako sa grab din. weekdays is sa carinderia ako bumibili and i have smart watch wherein pinipilit ko maka 10k steps a day, di ako humihiga ng di sya nagvavibrate ng step goal and tumatakbo rin ako every weekend sometimes pag maaga nakakauwi pati weekdays pero rare yan so yun. no to sedentary lifestyle kahit walk man lang na exercise tapos bawas processed food unless processed yung ginagamit sa mga carinderia 😭 pag dinner naman minsan tinapay lang ganun sa bakery or kaya water water na lang kasi nagdadiet, lalo na kakatapos lang ng holy week, umuwi ako sa bahay na every hour kumakain aq (sarap kasi kumain sa bahay walang budget limit)",still manage digit savings despite k salary earner,title says im sharing still manage digit savings despite k salary earner net pay around k mandatory contributions reference live alone manila almost years di po ako nagpapadala ng pera sa family sa province unless ask tho super rare kasi parents senior citizen high pension first started working sa manila used live dorm near workplace pay k monthly bills rent utilities laundry internet data minimum wage year manage save around k around time kasi medyo magastos din ako nun like gala gamit sa bahay kaartehan gadgets etc months back moved onebedroom apartment bumagsak talaga savings ko nun still manage digits sa savings ko pag lipat ko despite big deposit another stuffs bought apartment right half used sa savings ko kasi yung ibang gamit recently ko lang nabili sa savings talaga ang bawas ko still halfway used current expenses per month rent p bills electricity water internet p grocery allowance p total around p rin see wala akong pang wants mostly kinukuha ko sa natitira sa k allowance ko pero month savings save around p per month keep close possible nitong nakaraan hindi umaabot ng k padala sa bahay na pa k k minsan pag may wants silang gamit pagkain ako na nagkukusa bumili kasi sila rin naggive nung panggastos ko first month lumipat ako sa manila na think around k din kasi nag aadjust pa ako sa lifestyle ko manage live p na panggastos transpo none since live near workplace walking distance load expiry data expiry calls texts lasts around months food rarely cook realized based sa computation ko na mas matipid mas healthy bibili na lang ako sa labas everyday kaysa magluluto wala rin akong ref puro delata lang instant noodles ever thing na consistent niluluto ko rice kg lasts weeks reference sa daily expenses ko sa work p breakfast p lunch minsan may merienda minsan wala sometimes buy biscuit na pwede istock sa work para may makain ako mas matipid allot p per day para sa food ko pero madalas di ko nako consume may days na nasosobrahan ako grocery madalas skincare household items lang panlinis lysol mga ganun lang binibili ko nag stock ako kapag sale weekends since sunday lang ko nagdedelata na lang ako minsan umoorder ako thru grab depende sa budget trip ko gumagala ka pa ba yes po madalas angkas pa yan papunta pauwi pero rarely lang since one day lang ako maglalaro na lang ako sa pc kaysa lumabas hahaha always see magastos still spend kapag gusto ko nabilhan ko pa designer bag yung nanay ko nung pasko pati ako pati bago nyang phone kaya naubos din month ko additional ipon paluwagan na nakuha ko week month pay still proud pag nakikita kong may ganitong savings ako kasi always think wala na akong budget pero never ako naubusan ng pera despite masinop naghahanap na ako ibang work earn kasi nakakapagod na yung days work walang work life balance pero di naman worth yung sahod experience lang need ko dito sa work ko kaya lf new opportunity na tayo sa katulad kong ganito kaliit sahod wag tayo magpauto sa mga kumpanyang milyon ang net profit every month lets look another opportunity kasi di makakabuhay ng pamilya ang ganitong sahod edit sa mga concern po baka maging sakitin ako kasi puro delata instant noodles ako weekends lang po yan rare pa yan kasi nagoorder ako sa grab din weekdays sa carinderia ako bumibili smart watch wherein pinipilit ko maka k steps day di ako humihiga ng di sya nagvavibrate ng step goal tumatakbo rin ako every weekend sometimes pag maaga nakakauwi pati weekdays pero rare yan yun sedentary lifestyle kahit walk man lang na exercise tapos bawas processed food unless processed yung ginagamit sa mga carinderia pag dinner naman minsan tinapay lang ganun sa bakery kaya water water na lang kasi nagdadiet lalo na kakatapos lang ng holy week umuwi ako sa bahay na every hour kumakain aq sarap kasi kumain sa bahay walang budget limit,0.95,,['KO'],neutral,0.53651416,negative,0.9999971389770508
1k5vose,pinoybigbrother,Check on BRINCE too if you want to kick si you know who - long read,"First of all alam ko na hindi lahat ng maingay sa soc med ay may laban sa botohan. Nasubaybayan ko na from Slater (medyo prominent na soc med nito) to Collab. 

But let me tell you one thing, all shit changed nung Gen 11. 

Lahat ng nakikita kong malakas sa timeline ko, for some reason sila naliligtas sa eviction. I was never surprised na all girls ang big 4 last season.

I tested my timelines (on diff soc med platforms) again the past 2 evictions this PBB Collab. Never akong kinabahan sa WilVer noon. Bago pa lang pumasok sa game room tinanggap ko na malalagasan na ang unang big 4 picks ko dahil mawawala na si Ashley. WilVer had no solid fanbase until River made rounds all over my tl. Partida everybody disliked Will noon, pero the campaign of casuals? I saw people giving their ipon manatili lang si River sa loob. I was also not surprised with RaMi scoring high. I follow alt accounts forda chika lang, and the time na nag spread na a sponsor gave a large sum for michael (perhaps an exec sa station niya, as per the rumors), sabay yung pag angat nila lalo sa vote poll. Dagdag pa yung mga super may crush kay ralph kasi grabe yung thirst edits on clock app and blue app. ACLey was the weakest sa tl ko. I see their effort but not as much as WilVer and RaMi. Factor rin na hati ang opinion kay Ashley noon at pet peeve ng lahat noon si AC. walang CV support at all. 

2nd eviction, mas lalong naging predictable with my tl. Neck and neck ang campaign between MicVer and ChaKira pero ang naging strength ng MicVer kahit second-time nominees sila ay 1) ang effective marketing with Gela, 2) underdog keme ni Michael dahil nga parang ang off ng nomination reasons sa kanya. This was Michael’s start of capturing cvs. Ang ChaKira, wala. kahit mataas engagements ni Charlie sa clock app at unang nabuo ang KiSh sa loob ng bahay than other lts, nawala sila sa radar ng cvs. Literal na Kishes at solid Charlie ang lumaban lang para sa ChaKira. Nawalan pa ng screentime sa primetime at ls kaya double combo. I knew sila ang bye bye and I was right again.

Ngayon, sobrang polarizing ng tl, pero iisa lang ang kutob ko. Nasa bottom ang BrInce right now. 
Ang daming nagsasabi na MiLi ang dehado pero ang meron sila ay 1) yung mga cvs na napamahal na kay michael kasi aminin naman naten, real af si kuya 2) cvs na nakuha ni emilio (he’s going down the river route) 3) ang kalampag ng fans nila na sila ang dehado kasi walang lt 4) may funds si emilio as first-time nominee. RaSti, meanwhile, has 1) the revenge ng kulto ni Dustin to prove the haters wrong 2) mga sarap na sarap talaga kay ralph at ayaw siyang madamay/solid fanbase niya 3) yung super lakas na RAZ fans na nagligtas sa kanila last eviction 4) cvs na gustong ikeep si dustin forda plot 5) screentime ng DB sa pt at ls

Now I will understand if you will say na ang lakas ng donations ng BrInce based sa transparency reports, pero di niyo ba naisip na baka hindi lang din all out magpakita ang ibang fans ng ibang nominees? All BrInce has rn are 1) mikbrent shippers - sila ang pinaka solid pero kulang sila sa appeal sa masa kasi hindi naman sila nilalayag sa primetime at di naman showy sa ls unlike dustbia 2) kakarampot na other ships - azbrent, bresnyr, etc. 

Ang wala ang BrInce ay kapangyarihan ng cvs (na bumuhay kay river non). Brent is bland for them while pet peeve din ng karamihan si Vince. grabe yung campaign against sa kanila esp ng big accounts dahil wala raw silang bilang sa story and that is expected: introverts na pinagsama, yung isa may nakaaway pa recently. Walang appeal si Vince at all sa masa bukod sa maging laughing stock ng pagka slow niya. Wala rin siyang solid fanbase. Ang dami pang Michael fans na ayaw kay Brent kasi may alleged one-sided beef si Brent against kay Michael. Di rin sila maingay sa primetime. For cvs wala rin kaso sa kanila na mawala sila over Dustin kasi wala nga silang bilang. Sad to say, para silang ChaKira. Literal na loveteam nagbubuhat sa kanila right now, nothing else. Bilang ang mga beses na may nakita akong BBS BRINCE sa tl ko.

TLDR
MiLi - mahal ng masa, tested ang power vote for michael kahit medyo nakakapagod na rin for their funds
RaSti - may revenge ang DB, napakalakas ng RAZ, keep D for the plot agenda
BrInce - mikbrent carrying the load, small ships lang yung iba, walang screentime, pet peeve pa si vince, cvs do not give a f about them

Theories sa current standing:
1. MiLi
2. RaSti
3. BrInce

I hope Im wrong kasi nag interested ako dun sa event sa blue app (iykyk 😉)

and yes nagpasend na ako ng pera sa friends kong may maya to vote for them kahit ako lang nanonood sa office.
