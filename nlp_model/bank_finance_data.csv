stocks,"I’m looking to re balance my portfolio a little bit this year. My risk tolerance is pretty high as I won’t touch some of these investments for a while. 


Current Roth portfolio: 

BRK.B

CCI

O

UNH

AMLP


I’d probably trim O and add more to CCI, as it’s been the better performer as of late. They both pay nice dividends. UNH I bought earlier last year and it did really well. I wish I sold after the CEO assassination but I don’t mind holding this one a little longer. I don’t think I want to add any new positions in my Roth. 


Main portfolio:

GOOG (looking to aggressively add if it dips below 160)

META (might add a little)

MELI (might add a little)

VST (honestly not sure what to do here but holding atm)

LB (holding)

TMDX (holding)


Names/industries I’m looking to add:

FIX (another data center name so not sure)

RDDT (after the huge drop idk)

UBER

HOOD

TPL

FOUR

Cyber security (looking at PANW/RBRK)

Private equity (looking at KKR/APO)

stocks,"In terms of Target, you've had an issue for a while now where WMT is really stealing market share as people trade down. Target is the middle and the middle is being eroded. Is the magnitude of the trade down sustainable? I don't know but I do think that the longer this trade down occurs and the more those people shop at WMT the more ingrained that becomes. How does Target compete against that? The primary thing is likely they have to compete on price, which is not great. Tariffs will be another issue. I would not be surprised if there is a new CEO sooner than later, but what can they really do?

So, I don't know. From my perspective, a problem I have with Target is that I look at the broader issues and I don't see it changing any time soon or easy answers to solve it.  That said, given what the stock has done and the situation as is at this point in time, how much of that is baked into the stock? It feels like the kind of thing where okay news could - at least temporarily - cause a nice rally. Any sort of improvement in the tariff situation could cause a rally. Of course, any material worsening of these situations (and if what's going on turns into more of a slowdown) could also cause further erosion.

""5k in SoFi""

I don't have anything against it really but I don't get the appeal. That said, I think the issue with JPM (and which will be more of an issue with something like SoFi) is that people view what's going on as a potential slowdown.

""all of them are down about 5%. So lost about 3k. It keeps going down. ""

It's a bummer that you're down but I think you have to look at it from the standpoint of given the market that we've had in a few weeks, a lot of people are down (I am, too) and how much are you down relative to your risk tolerance, goals, index, etc? The market has bad days, weeks, months and it's never fun by any means but it becomes if someone is very stressed by all this, then they have to make some changes in their portfolio (too much risk and/or too much money in the market.)  To me, this sort of situation where names are increasingly oversold, stuff down 20-30%+ in a month, sentiment horrible on a historic level is when you want to not be overly stressed by the market and instead look around and *gradually* start buying at least a bit of what everyone else is throwing out.",term target issue wmt really stealing market share people trade target middle middle eroded magnitude trade sustainable know think longer trade occurs people shop wmt ingrained becomes target compete primary thing likely compete price great tariff another issue would surprised new ceo sooner later really know perspective problem target look broader issue see changing time soon easy answer solve said given stock done situation point time much baked stock feel like kind thing okay news could least temporarily cause nice rally sort improvement tariff situation could cause rally course material worsening situation going turn slowdown could also cause erosion k sofi anything really get appeal said think issue jpm issue something like sofi people view going potential slowdown lost k keep going bummer think look standpoint given market week lot people much relative risk tolerance goal index etc market bad day week month never fun mean becomes someone stressed make change portfolio much risk much money market sort situation name increasingly oversold stuff month sentiment horrible historic level want overly stressed market instead look around gradually start buying least bit everyone else throwing,Comment,['JPM'],Banks & Finance
stocks,"You're almost 100% in US tech. That is, you have 100% exposure to one country on earth and 0% to 194 others. You are 100% in a massively overvalued market and 0% in companies with competitive valuations. You are 100% in companies that are extremely vulnerable to geopolitical events and recessions and 0% in companies that fare well in that environment. You are 100% in established companies that may well be past their prime and 0% in new opportunities. 

The other person is right - there's no inherent reason to sell at a loss unless your thesis has changed. It's just that this should never have been your portfolio in the first place unless you have an insane level of confidence in US Tech. Also, it's highly questionable how you can possibly be optimistic about all of these companies or even know much about them - I'm willing to bet anything you don't have a strong understanding of most of them. 

I would do a few things:

1. Figure out which companies you actually understand and are confident in. 

2. Find two BM ETFs: one Europe, one Int'l, and at bare minimum stick 25% (but realistically more) into those even if you're utterly confident that the US will reach new heights in the very near future. 

3. Consider selling anything you bought because you saw it on wallstreetbets or on YouTube, which is what a lot of this looks like, or at least thoroughly research the company. 

4. It's tempting to keep what's in the red, but it has no bearing on future performance. Hold or don't, but be aware of your own bias and understand that there is zero relationship between a stock being down and future performance. Sometimes they come back, other times they're red for a reason and don't come back, or if they do your money is still better put elsewhere. 

My PERSONAL sell list, and this is pure opinion because there are arguments either way, would definitely include: GOOG, TSLA, PYPL, META, and SOFI. I would personally consider keeping JPM, NIO, and AMD. Again, this is personal opinion, take it as such. I would also go way more than 25% int'l, but one can make a reasonable argument for anywhere between 25% and 100% non-US, so my previous rec was conservative because if in doubt it's better to stay closer to the status quo.",almost u tech exposure one country earth others massively overvalued market company competitive valuation company extremely vulnerable geopolitical event recession company fare well environment established company may well past prime new opportunity person right inherent reason sell loss unless thesis changed never portfolio first place unless insane level confidence u tech also highly questionable possibly optimistic company even know much willing bet anything strong understanding would thing figure company actually understand confident find two bm etf one europe one int l bare minimum stick realistically even utterly confident u reach new height near future consider selling anything bought saw wallstreetbets youtube lot look like least thoroughly research company tempting keep red bearing future performance hold aware bias understand zero relationship stock future performance sometimes come back time red reason come back money still better put elsewhere personal sell list pure opinion argument either way would definitely include goog tsla pypl meta sofi would personally consider keeping jpm nio amd personal opinion take would also go way int l one make reasonable argument anywhere non u previous rec conservative doubt better stay closer status quo,Comment,['JPM'],Banks & Finance

Biggest risk is the macro over the retail industry.

stocks,"This is from the UGL prospectus:  
""In order to achieve its investment objective, each of the Funds intends to invest in financial instruments (“Financial Instruments”) in the

manner and to the extent described herein. Financial Instruments are instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset,

rate or benchmark (such asset, rate or benchmark, a “Reference Asset”) and include futures contracts, swap agreements, forward contracts,

option contracts, and other instruments. The Funds will not invest directly in any commodities or currencies.""

Let me emphasize: ""**not invest directly in any commodities**""

So what exactly is happening here? It's just a fund. A pile of money, operated by people, that speculates on contracts based on some set of rules.

I learned this the hard way having ""invested"" in aluminum a while back. There was a point where I had to sign some promise of receipt for some trucks of aluminum, and I freaked out. So then I started to go the ETF route, where the feature is that I was no longer exposed to delivery risk, but the outcome is that I don't actually get any real aluminum if I ever actually wanted aluminum.

So in the case of ""gold"" this is feature is actually completely opposite to what people imagine they're buying when they buy ""gold"". If the markets actually tank, where will you get the gold? How? The funds that hold these are likely banks, and those banks are likely exposed also, so it's simply dollars at the end of it.

I actually know some people that wanted to get around an oil speculation ETF, so they actually bought the contracts, and then when storage wasn't available anywhere, they had to pay money for someone else to pickup their oil contracts because where are they going to even park tankers full of crude oil?

It's pretty crazy how stuff works under the hood. Gotta read the prospectus.

Also remember: when sh\* hits the fan, banks are made whole first, before investors.

CORRECTION:  
Earlier, I had the wrong tab loaded and was actually copying from UGL instead of GLD.

GLD looks much better under the hood:  
""The custodian is HSBC Bank plc (the “Custodian”) and is responsible for the safekeeping of the Trust’s gold bars transferred to it in connection with thecreation of Baskets by Authorized Participants. The Custodian also facilitates the transfer of gold in and out of the Trust through gold accounts itmaintains for Authorized Participants and the Trust. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA.

At August 31, 2022, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by the Custodian in its vault was 31,582,529 ounces, 100% of which is allocatedgold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of $53,698,529,317 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on August 31, 2022(cost—$50,824,771,861)

The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust.

Proceeds received by the Trust from the issuance and sale of Baskets consist of gold and, possibly from time to time, cash. Pursuant to the Trust Indenture, during the life of the Trust the gold and any cash will only be (1) held by the Trust, (2) distributed to Authorized Participants in connection with the redemption of Baskets or (3) sold or disbursed as needed to pay the Trust’s ongoing expenses

 CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Friday that he thinks the U.S. economy has weakened to the point of growth possibly turning negative.

“I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said on “Squawk on the Street.”

Fears of an economic slowdown have risen sharply since President Donald Trump unveiled widespread tariffs last week, sparking a sell-off in the stock market. Trump on Wednesday announced that he was pausing some of those import levies for 90 days, but that move is not enough to restore confidence in the economy, Fink said.

> The dollar slumped to a three-year low on Friday and Treasury yields climbed steeply as US President Donald Trump’s trade policy continued to send shockwaves through global markets.
> 
> An index of the dollar’s value against currencies of big US trading partners fell as much as 1.8 per cent on Friday to 99 before recovering to 99.7. The rare move below 100 took the dollar to its lowest level since April 2022.
> 
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose 0.19 percentage points to 4.58 per cent, surpassing the highs reached on Wednesday when Trump reversed most of his so-called reciprocal tariffs. It fell back to 4.54 per cent by mid-morning in New York. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
> 
> “The question of a potential dollar confidence crisis has now been definitively answered — we are experiencing one in full force,” said Francesco Pesole, an FX strategist at ING.
> 
> US stocks slipped slightly in early trading on Friday, with the S&P 500 index falling 0.6 per cent during the morning session.
> 
> European stocks were mixed in afternoon trading, having see-sawed earlier in the session. The region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.4 per cent. The FTSE 100 was up 0.4 per cent, with Germany’s Dax down 1.4 per cent and France’s Cac 40 down 0.6 per cent.

stocks,"Stop basing everything off day-to-day price swings. This will not be reversed in a single day. Wait 2 months. You'll see Monday was not the bottom.

Each individual day in a bear market is unpredictable. Will the market go up? Will it go down? Who knows. Why are people buying when China and Europe both announced reciprocal tariffs? I have absolutely no idea. Just acknowledge there will be individual up weeks and individual down weeks. Don't try to time it on a micro level. Instead make a prediction based on the fundamentals of the economy, and then stick to your gut, disregarding emotion.

If your thesis is that tariffs are going to be destructive to consumer spending, profit margins and the economy as a whole then wait patiently. Each individual day will swing wildly, but if you're right the market will trend down over time.

What you really want to do is estimate the total cost of tariffs in some percentage or dollar terms. Try to make a quantifiable prediction you can verify. Firm up something like ""I think Trump's tariff policy will halve the value of the global economy because of x, y and z"" - and then set your price target at 50% the price of SPY at peak. Commit to buy back in at that level (maybe Dollar Cost Average over a month after that price point to catch the average price instead of getting stung by a daily swing). Re-evaluate your thesis each month based on how the tariffs are actually impacting the economy - not based on a tweet, or news, or Reddit consensus or what you think other people are thinking. Look at earnings reports, read P&Ls of companies that make up the bulk of the S&P, look at consumer spending, speak to relatives and friends and see if they're hurting or cutting down on their spending, and then compare that to your prediction.

stocks,"Wednesday’s jaw-dropping stock-market rally on President Donald Trump’s surprising tariff reversal is one for the history books.

The S&P 500 skyrocketed 9.52% in a kneejerk reaction to Trump’s announcement to put a 90-day pause on some of the lofty ‘reciprocal’ tariffs. The one-day gain ranks as the third biggest since World War II for the main stock market benchmark, according to FactSet.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2,962.86 points, or 7.87% and posted its biggest advance since March 2020.

The Nasdaq Composite jumped 12.16%, notching its largest one-day jump since January 2001 and second-best day ever. 

“This is the pivotal moment we’ve been waiting for,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group. “The immediate market reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, as investors interpret this as a step toward much-needed clarity.”

The market was a coiled spring after a brutal four-day stretch that briefly pushed the S&P 500 into bear-market territory. Over the course of the previous four trading sessions, the S&P 500 suffered a 12% loss, a decline not seen since the pandemic. The Dow lost more than 4,500 points during the four-day stretch, while the Nasdaq was down more than 13%.

While stocks managed to recoup much of the losses, investors are not completely out of the woods as Trump vows to reorient global trade. The president said more than 75 countries contacted U.S. officials to negotiate after he unveiled his new tariffs last week.

“It’s still too early to signal an all clear,” said Dave Sekera, Morningstar’s chief U.S. market strategist. “Trade negotiations have yet to start and once they do, there will be positive and negative headlines as each party positions itself to extract the maximum amount of concessions possible.”

Most of you guys would be a lot better off if you just took an allocation and did a couple of things. You have three indexes. The s&p 500 the NASDAQ and you can use the Russell 2000 or the s&p 600, depends on if you want the unprofitable but possibly fast growing small Caps or just the small caps with actual earnings 

What you do with these three is add and reduce the percentage of each depending on market conditions. NASDAQ has been the hot trade for, god a long time now. It's not always going to be this way. When it's not you rotate into what is and start feeding that. Small caps have been underperforming which is why they go on watch. You're starting to run into these weird historical trends where they should outperform again relatively soon. The s&p 500 you feed regardless. When the market has dips, don't pay attention to the headlines, add money. 20% is always a heavy add. People can say well if you would have bought during 2008 it still went down a lot more. Yeah sure but number one good luck forecasting the bottom. Number two how many people are upset they bought back in 2008 right now? So there you go. This most recent event had the chance of going systemic. We had a miniature GFC and had Scott bessent and apparently Jamie dimon had the effect they did on Trump we could be in a different situation. With what bonds were doing the other night, you were setting up for another leg down and there was no technical support under 4,800 until, at least 4,500 and the strong support was 4200. The longer it would have gone on the more it would have gotten into the real economy. The fact this all happened so fast means it did not infect the actual economy that much. It's not on the shelf. You didn't have a lot of jobs get cut because of it. The damage is relatively minor and it's all because a couple of choices which tells you it's impossible to predict. All you can do is feed the beast when things go on sale

If you have on a lot of high risk, so you have a large Bitcoin position or you have a lot of zero earnings tech stocks that are trading on hype. Cutting those is a good idea or reducing exposure I should say. Because if this would have cracked. Really good chance Bitcoin would be down another 50%. Really good chance a lot of those companies with no earnings would be down 50 to 90%. Things get really ugly and you want to retain quality. We had a reversal, we have a floor under the market.

stocks,"Hi Everyone,

Ever feel like the stock market has become less about investing and more about deciphering cryptic messages from a certain someone's social media? Lately, it seems like President Trump's tweets have more sway over our portfolios than any earnings report or economic indicator. Let's dive into this rollercoaster and see how it's turning seasoned investors into bewildered gamblers.

**The Tweet That Shook Wall Street**

Picture this: it's a regular Wednesday morning, you're sipping your coffee, and suddenly your phone buzzes. It's a notification from Truth Social: President Trump has just posted, ""BUY."" No context, no specifics—just a three-letter command.

Before you can say ""market manipulation,"" stocks are soaring. The S&P 500 jumps 9.5%, adding a cool $4 trillion in value. Investors who heeded the ambiguous advice are celebrating, while the rest of us are left scratching our heads, wondering if we should start following political figures for investment tips.

**Tariffs Today, Gone Tomorrow**

Just a week prior, the market was in freefall. President Trump announced sweeping 10% tariffs on all imports, sending the Dow plummeting 2,000 points. Panic ensued, retirement accounts wept, and financial analysts were dusting off their recession playbooks.

Then, in a plot twist, Trump hits pause on the tariffs for 90 days (**thinking due to Bonds**) and declares, ""This is a great time to buy."" Suddenly, the market rebounds as if it had a double shot of espresso. It's enough to give even the most seasoned investor whiplash.

**Investing or Gambling?**

With such unpredictability, one has to wonder: is investing still about analysis and intuition, or has it become a game of chance? At least in a casino, the odds are known. In today's market, insider trading whispers and policy flip-flops make the roulette wheel seem downright stable.",hi everyone ever feel like stock market become le investing deciphering cryptic message certain someone social medium lately seems like president trump tweet sway portfolio earnings report economic indicator let dive rollercoaster see turning seasoned investor bewildered gambler tweet shook wall street picture regular wednesday morning sipping coffee suddenly phone buzz notification truth social president trump posted buy context specific three letter command say market manipulation stock soaring p jump adding cool trillion value investor heeded ambiguous advice celebrating rest u left scratching head wondering start following political figure investment tip tariff today gone tomorrow week prior market freefall president trump announced sweeping tariff import sending dow plummeting point panic ensued retirement account wept financial analyst dusting recession playbook plot twist trump hit pause tariff day thinking due bond declares great time buy suddenly market rebound double shot espresso enough give even seasoned investor whiplash investing gambling unpredictability one wonder investing still analysis intuition become game chance least casino odds known today market insider trading whisper policy flip flop make roulette wheel seem downright stable,Body,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

**Increase inflationary pressure in the US, costing American families.**

>The tariffs will increase inflationary pressure in the US. The Budget Lab at Yale University forecasts that when other countries retaliate with countermeasures, the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will rise by 2.1 percent, costing US families with low, medium, and high incomes, as the ultimate “payer” of the tariffs, an average of US$1,300, US$2,100, US$5,400 per household respectively. With the imposition of the new round of tariffs, pressure on the retail price of daily consumer goods such as food, clothing, electronics, and daily necessities will increase significantly.

  
**Weaken the US industrial base and aggravate supply chain risks.**  

>The tariffs will weaken the US industrial base. The Trump administration intends that these tariffs will force the reshoring of the US manufacturing industry. In reality the tariffs will gradually affect the industrial chain and supply chain, aggravate the risk of supply chain disruption and industrial hollowing out, and add to problems hindering the development of manufacturing. The Peterson Institute for International Economics assesses that over 90 percent of the tariff costs will be borne by US importers, by downstream businesses, and ultimately, through higher prices, by the end consumers.

  
**Aggravate panic in the financial market**

>The tariffs will aggravate panic in the financial market. On the day following the announcement of the tariffs, the three major US stock indexes each declined by more than 5 percent. Meanwhile, the US dollar has fallen hard against the euro, demonstrating the growing concern of the market at the disruption of the economy, and the drastic impact on confidence.

  
**Increase the risk of a US economic recession**

>The tariffs will increase the risk of US economic recession. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and other US financial institutions have all substantially increased their odds of the risk of a US recession. According to their research, the US tariffs and the countermeasures of other countries could lead to a reduction of US real GDP by approximately 1 percentage point.

(Bloomberg) — [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs.

An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. The company identified international trade disputes as a risk factor in its annual report released in February. “China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods,” the company said.

It’s unclear how widespread the cancellations are and how many types of merchandise they affect.

One vendor who has been selling beach chairs made in China to Amazon for more than a decade received an email from the company last week that said it was canceling some purchase orders it placed “in error“ and instructed the vendor not to ship them. The email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg, didn’t mention tariffs.

The vendor said the $500,000 wholesale order was nixed after the chairs had already been manufactured, leaving this person on the hook to pay the factory and find other buyers. The vendor, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from Amazon, said the company had never canceled one of its orders in such as manner.

Scott Miller, a former Amazon vendor manager who now works as an e-commerce consultant, said Amazon canceled orders for merchandise made in China and other Asian countries from several of his clients. The cancellations came without warning, he said, and could force vendors to renegotiate terms with the e-commerce company.

“Amazon really holds all of the cards,” said Miller, founder and CEO of pdPlus in Minneapolis. “The only real recourse vendors have is to either sell this inventory in other countries at lower margins or try to work with other retailers.”

The beach chair vendor and Miller said Amazon cancelled “direct import orders,” a process in which Amazon buys inventory wholesale in the country in which it is made and ships the products to its warehouses in the United States. Amazon serves as the importer of record for the orders, which means it pays tariffs when the products reach US ports.

Amazon has been importing items this way for years as a way to reduce costs since Amazon can often use bulk shipping rates to import items at lower costs than vendors. Canceling those orders puts the tariff exposure back on vendors if they import merchandise to the US by other means.

Items Amazon buys directly from vendors account for about 40% of the products sold on its website. The rest of the company’s sales are made by independent merchants who essentially rent digital shelf space from Amazon, paying the company commissions and fees for logistics and advertising.

Trump’s tariffs have rattled global markets. Many businesses are raising prices, stoking fears of a recession. On Tuesday, Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc. reduced its 2025 revenue forecast for Amazon, citing the effects of tariffs in a research note.

stocks,"A sharp sell-off in U.S. government bond markets has sparked fears about the growing fallout from President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and retaliation by China, the European Union and others, raising questions about what is typically seen as the safest corner for investors to take cover during times of turmoil.

Yields on 10-year Treasuries — the benchmark for a wide variety of debt — shot 0.2 percentage points higher on Wednesday, to 4.45 percent, a big move in that market. Just a few days ago, it had traded below 4 percent. Yields on the 30-year bond rose significantly as well, at one point on Wednesday topping 5 percent. Borrowing costs globally have also shot higher.

The sell-off comes as investors have fled riskier assets globally in what some fear has parallels to what became known as the “dash for cash” episode during the pandemic, when the Treasury market broke down. The recent moves have upended a longstanding relationship in which the U.S. government bond market serves as a safe harbor during times of stress.

Volatility has surged as stock markets have plummeted amid fears that the U.S. economy is hurtling toward stagflation, in which economic growth contracts while inflation surges. The S&P 500 is now on the verge of entering a bear market, meaning it has dropped 20 percent from its recent high.

But the moves have been significant enough to raise broader concerns about how foreign investors now perceive United States, after Mr. Trump decided to slap onerous tariffs on nearly all of its trading partners. Some countries have sought to strike deals with the administration to lower their tariff rates. But China retaliated on Wednesday, announcing an 84 percent levy on U.S. goods after Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate on Chinese goods to 104 percent.

In a social media post on Wednesday, the former U.S. Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers said the broader sell-off suggested a “generalized aversion to US assets in global financial markets” and warned about the possibility of a “serious financial crisis wholly induced by US government tariff policy.”

Recession is closer than we think now. Countries selling off US bonds is just gonna increase, nobody can trust the US anymore.. get ready for maximum pain.

stocks,"As someone who is not directly invested in the market but monitors it closely to assess broader economic trends that affect my personal financial planning, I find it troubling that recent market fluctuations—particularly the current non-communicative bounce—are being attributed primarily to presidential influence rather than underlying economic fundamentals. Many prominent CEOs and financial leaders, including Larry Fink of BlackRock, have signaled that the U.S. economy is either in a recession or heading toward one. Their assessments are based not on partisan narratives, but on macroeconomic indicators such as slowed consumer spending, tightening credit conditions, and declining investor confidence.

Just last week, the market experienced its most significant downturn since 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 crash in early 2020. This level of volatility cannot be dismissed, especially when it reflects deep-seated structural concerns rather than isolated events. The administration’s current economic policy posture appears reactive rather than strategic, and its impact—both domestically and internationally—is increasingly viewed with skepticism.

Even if short-term trade deals or policy shifts provide temporary relief, the long-term erosion of global trust in American economic leadership is a critical issue.

stocks,"The VIX, or Volatility Index, measures the market's expectations for volatility over the next 30 days. It’s often called the ""fear gauge"" because it tends to spike when markets are turbulent.

Here’s how the VIX moves:


---

1. Derived from Options

The VIX is calculated from the prices of S&P 500 index options (calls and puts).

When investors expect big moves (up or down), they buy options for protection or profit — this increases option prices, which pushes the VIX higher.



---

2. Moves Inversely to the Market (Generally)

Market drops → VIX rises: Investors get nervous, demand for options increases.

Market rises or is calm → VIX falls: Less demand for protection, options are cheaper.



---

3. Non-directional

VIX reflects expected volatility, not direction. It doesn't care whether the market is going up or down — just how big the move might be.



---

4. Spikes Fast, Falls Slowly

VIX often spikes quickly during panic (like in crashes or bad news).

It tends to decline gradually as calm returns to markets.



---

5. Mean-Reverting

The VIX tends to return to a long-term average (often around 15-20 historically).

Very high or very low levels usually don’t last forever.



---

If you want, I can show you a chart or give examples of VIX behavior during big market events (like COVID crash, 2008, etc.).",vix volatility index measure market expectation volatility next day often called fear gauge tends spike market turbulent vix move derived option vix calculated price p index option call put investor expect big move buy option protection profit increase option price push vix higher move inversely market generally market drop vix rise investor get nervous demand option increase market rise calm vix fall le demand protection option cheaper non directional vix reflects expected volatility direction care whether market going big move might spike fast fall slowly vix often spike quickly panic like crash bad news tends decline gradually calm return market mean reverting vix tends return long term average often around historically high low level usually last forever want show chart give example vix behavior big market event like covid crash etc,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

**This is from a real financial advisor and a life-long friend of mine. This is a wonderful time to make money.**

"" This is all just fear-mongering by the left-wing media. They hate Trump because he’s threatening their control and their money. Right now, America’s news outlets are leaning far left. People are sheep, they'll believe whatever CNBC headlines tell them.

Trump strong-arming this should work. Eventually, China - or whoever retaliates - will realize it’s not worth losing trillions. There will be negotiations, which more likely than not will favor America. America's economy and military are FAR too strong for it to go any other way.

Stocks and Bitcoin should stabilize, then advance. Just like always. Anyone panicking and selling long positions over this is inevitably going to regret doing so.

This is just a blip. Eventually, everyone will wish they’d bought in on “liberation day.” This liberal-led panic sell will die the second we negotiate - or two years max, if China can even hold out that long. I doubt they will. America is their #1 importer.

It should all work out in the end. This song and dance hasn’t changed since 1890 - I doubt it will now.

I should say - the only way this doesn’t work out is if China retaliates militarily. Then you’re looking at 5+ years for new highs on Bitcoin or the S&P, or the destruction of China and potentially multiple countries. I have no guess as to what would unfold if it went nuclear. This scenario is beyond unlikely. Military stock would be the next AI if there is any threat. Amazon would restructure into a defense contractor. Their stock would be invaluable.

stocks,"US doesn’t export anything anymore to China, China exports something less than today, some companies are going to be strongly hit (looking at you, Apple) and will have to sell stuff made in China in Europe and find a solution to manage the global pariah that is USA. Might even be, based on the relative tariffs, that some new business starts (eg if routing stuff from China to the UK to US costs less than selling directly to the US, someone is going to try that).

Also, tariffs are shit, but the effect is a bit different than you think. 100% tariff doesn’t mean final price is 2x. Let’s try with a small example (I’ve simplified a lot excluding sales taxes, transportation etc, but bear with me, results are similar if we include those): if an iphone cost 500$ to make in China and sell to Apple US, and Apple sells it to the end consumer in US for 1000$, thus generating a 500$ margin, a 100% tariff on that import is going to make the import cost 1000$ (500$ cost, 500$ tariff). If Apple wants to keep the same margin the iPhone will then cost 1500$ (500$ cost of the import, 500$ tariff, 500$ margin). In that case is a 50% increase in the final price, not 100%.

Even from that simple example you’ll get why this move from the US is stupid if they want to reindustrialize: that kind of tariff is more impactful on low margins products. Basically, you’re (maybe) importing shitty jobs building low value added stuff, and putting at risk high value jobs. Tariffs might be a solution for some specific issue, but not to reindustrialize an economy with high wages and cost of living, as you’re creating jobs people won’t want to do

Going back to your question: yes, I think the S&P hasn’t fully priced in this reality. It’s even worse than you think: it’s not about trade modifying, it’s about globalization coming to an end because its main sponsor and biggest beneficiary decided they don’t want it anymore.

stocks,"For the US, the inflationary pressure would be immediate and brutal. China’s still the manufacturing backbone for a huge chunk of consumer goods—think phones, laptops, apparel, even basic components like screws or plastics. Doubling tariffs doesn’t just mean a 50-100% price hike on the sticker; it compounds through supply chains. Companies either eat the cost (crushing margins) or pass it on (hello, $1,500 iPhones). Domestic production could pick up some slack, but not fast—retooling takes years, and US labor costs aren’t cheap. The Fed might have to slam rates higher to tame that inflation, risking a recession. S&P 500? A lot of those multinationals—Apple, Nike, Walmart—rely on China. Earnings get hit, valuations compress. The market’s optimism feels like it’s banking on a last-minute trade truce, but if this is the new normal, yeah, there’s downside nobody’s ready for.

China’s not exactly laughing either. Their export machine stalls—US is still a top market—and a devalued yuan might juice competitiveness short-term, but it’s a band-aid on a broken leg. They’ve got debt piles, a property bubble wheezing its last breaths, and a workforce shrinking faster than their GDP growth can fake it. Tariffs force them to pivot—more to Europe, Southeast Asia, Belt and Road pals—but that’s not a plug-and-play fix. Their markets might keep levitating on state steroids, but fragility’s baked in. A weaker yuan also means capital flight risks; rich Chinese don’t trust a sinking ship.

Globally, supply chains fracture. Everyone picks sides or scrambles for alternatives—Vietnam, India, Mexico get a boom, but they can’t scale like China did. Costs rise everywhere. Trade volumes shrink. Equities worldwide take a bath as growth slows. The US consumer, already stretched, cuts back; China’s factories idle. Stagflation vibes start creeping in.

The kicker? Neither side backs down easy. US politics loves China-bashing—it’s bipartisan now. China’s got Xi’s pride and a system that can’t admit weakness. So this could drag on, with tit-for-tat escalations. Markets might be underestimating it because they’re hooked on hopium—decades of globalization don’t unwind without pain, and we’re only seeing the opening act.

stocks,"During times of volatility it’s best to remind yourself of a few things. 

1. **There is generally no good understanding of why stocks fall a certain percent on a certain day.** You’ll see articles like “Stocks Fall on Fears of Tariffs”, and while that’s an excellent guess, even experts do not know why the market reacts the way it does. Markets shrug off real bad news all the time, and over react to mediocre news. If, tomorrow, the S&P 500 drops 1%, what will the journalists say? “S&P 500 calm as businesses react to tariffs”? That doesn’t mean anything. There is no formula f(a,b,c,…) = price, and no one knows how investors will react to news. Why is the market seemingly jumping today? Conspiracy? Did everyone just have a good Sunday and woke up ready to buy? Who knows. 

2. **Even experts aren’t sure how world events will affect stock prices.** Do most people think tariffs will depress corporate earnings and start expensive trade wars? Sure. Will it happen exactly like that? Maybe. *Even if it does*, do we know how much it will depress earnings? Do we know how many people will lose their jobs? Do we know if all that will actually result in a >40% plunge in prices? No. We really don’t. 

3. **Emotions cloud judgement.** The market falls and you get spooked, that’s fine. But, trump announces tariffs and there’s thousands of news articles about the end of American hegemony and our imminent self-destruction and blah blah blah blah. These similar articles were written 2016-2020, then Biden was president, now Trump is president. Anyone here selling their stock while proclaiming the end of America, is clearly emotional, not clairvoyant. And if they put all their wealth in American dollars, are they really protecting themselves from the outcomes of their thesis? I don’t think so. If you truly believed these theories, you would be focused on other things. But if you say that, liquidate your portfolio, and then go to your office job the next day, eat dinner and watch a movie, well, that was likely pure raw emotion. Or you’re just embracing the incoming storm. 

And avoid posts about what everyone is feeling. If you want to know then check prices in the markets and options exchanges. That’s the most accurate data about market sentiment you’ll be able to find, and even if you follow it, once again no one knows if those feelings will result in prices going lower or higher.

stocks,"EddyElfenbein to explain what really happened on Monday. My oh my. 


"" On Monday, the stock market had an especially volatile morning. In just eight minutes, the S&P 500 rallied 5.66%. It then promptly lost 4.37% over the next seven minutes. We’re talking about several trillion dollars magically appearing and disappearing during less time than a lunchbreak.


What happened? Well, that’s a good question. It appears that Kevin Hassett, the Director of the National Economic Council, was being interview on Fox News. During the interview he was asked if the president was considering a 90-day pause for his tariff policies. Hassett clearly gave a non-committal answer (“the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.”)


Somehow someone on Twitter took that for a yes and tweeted it out. That was from a small account (less than 1,000 followers), but soon a much larger account known as “Walter Bloomberg” reposted it, and suddenly, this was taken as serious news on Wall Street.


I should add that Walter Bloomberg is not connected with Bloomberg, the financial news service. His tweet came out at 10:11 am and by 10:12 am, CNN reported that cheers erupted on the floor of the NYSE. I guess that’s a good barometer of how unpopular the tariffs are on Wall Street.


At CNBC, the anchors were completely baffled by the market’s surge and by 10:15 am, they were reporting on the news. Soon Reuters was referencing CNBC but they were only going on what Twitter was saying. Soon people were referencing people who were referencing people who were just making things up.""",eddyelfenbein explain really happened monday oh monday stock market especially volatile morning eight minute p rallied promptly lost next seven minute talking several trillion dollar magically appearing disappearing le time lunchbreak happened well good question appears kevin hassett director national economic council interview fox news interview asked president considering day pause tariff policy hassett clearly gave non committal answer president going decide president going decide somehow someone twitter took yes tweeted small account le follower soon much larger account known walter bloomberg reposted suddenly taken serious news wall street add walter bloomberg connected bloomberg financial news service tweet came cnn reported cheer erupted floor nyse guess good barometer unpopular tariff wall street cnbc anchor completely baffled market surge reporting news soon reuters referencing cnbc going twitter saying soon people referencing people referencing people making thing,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

According to the historical data shared by analysts, both the key indices have triggered a rare sell-off signal.

Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist of Carson Research, highlighted in an X post that if the S&P 500 closes down by 4% on Monday, it would mark the third consecutive day of a 4% or greater decline. He states that this has only happened three times in history, all during the Great Depression.

Similarly, Jason Goepfert, a consultant at White Oak Consultancy LLC, notes that futures indicate a loss greater than 3% for the Dow Jones. If this occurs, it would also be the third consecutive loss greater than 3%, which has only happened four times during the Great Depression.

For the S&P500 what is really important is the collective of factors that has been propping up the american economy and success:

\- Dollar being the reserve currency of the whole world and world trade.

\- The whole world using american services (Netflix, Youtube, AWS etc), consultancy, banking etc (swift, visa, ..).

\- The consumerism of US citizens, being the best monitized and highest paying.

\- US Military, alliences and NATO, intellegence collection organizations, etc.

  
The tariffs are currently potentially destroying the first (the dollar) and the third (us consumerism) by isolating the US from its allies and accelerating the decline of the empire.

The EU is already talking about sanctioning or tariffing the american services, that would be a great blow too. Those are highest paying jobs in US and the foundation of S&P500 (magnificent 7).

In my opinion, if at least one of those things is completely collapsed then we might not see the S&P500 hitting the same highs and peaks that we have seen, but we are still far away from that.

Every fact is irrelevant if you're not paying attention. I don't know what you're trying to get at. It doesn't matter that the earth's temperature is rising somewhat exponentially since the industrial revolution if the only thing you care about is the fact there is still ice in Antarctica.

It's important because not often do we get 10-20% gains in a day while we are often getting 5% losses per day for the past few days.

stocks,"It's not hard to time a top, it's almost impossible to time a bottom. I went from 10% to 30% cash in the week before the initial tariffs on Canada kicked-in. I should have gone 50% or more before the second wave of tariffs as it was obvious... but I just held. Anyway, I am starting to slowly get back in the market. Now at 25% cash. I usually keep around 10% cash in each account. The goal is just to buy significantly lower than I sold so I am in a better position than I would have been had I just done nothing. If I drop everything back in right now, that's already a big win. I will recover much sooner than I would have otherwise.

For now I'm not touching anything. If the tariff war escalates with China and we drop to 4500 on the S&P, I'll drop another 5% cash in the market. Otherwise, I'm fine with making 3% in cash ETFs and simply waiting for earnings and most likely the official ""we're in a recession"" call and drop that money. If this is a long flat bottom, I'll just switch to a more DCA approach every other week until I'm back under 10%.

Once you move passed the binary, black and white vision of things, and understand that you win any time you buy much lower than you sold (on indexes at least), the pressure goes away and the picture becomes much clearer.

If you know you have a hard time staying high in cash because you don't follow financial news and don't have an entry plan, just let your advisor take over. It's already a very good move.

stocks,"1. Diversify. Don't put all your money into one stock, one sector, one country, one anything. 

2. Understand your investment. Don't invest in something because of some vague notion or because someone told you it's good. Investing without understanding what you're buying is dumb, period. It's like walking into walmart and giving them $500 for a mystery box of random crap. Dead mouse? Kids pajamas? Expired ketchup? 

3. Don't check in every day. A buy and hold investor checks in every few months or a couple of times per year. You will not be able to psychologically handle a drop if you're spending all the live long day watching the ticker go up and down. 

4. If in doubt, buy broad market ETFs and just hold them. A standard allocation is one S&P 500 (SPY/VOO as the other person suggested), one FTSE Europe/STOXX 600, and one All-World Ex-US in equal proportions. This is recommended quite often because you can never crash too hard, and you'll get in on all the upturns. If the US crashes dot-com style, you've got the rest of the world. If tech crashes, you've got all the other sectors. If China goes on a tear, you'll get a bit of that. If banks start printing, it'll print you a slice of the pie. 

5. Repeat after me: Dividends are not. free. money. They can be a useful tool, but they aren't someone generously donating money to you like a charity every month. You're paying for that in lost growth and then some. 

6. There are a lot of sexy looking things out there. Options that can 50x your money in a week. Leveraged ETFs (3x growth, score!). Penny stocks that will SURELY explode any day now. These are all tools for the right person and the right goals. Don't use them until you have literally read entire books on them and have some experience. If you do, understand that at some point you're basically gambling. 

7. Reddit is full of confident people who sound like they've seen the light and can predict world events or tell you whether tomorrow will be red or green. I see one commentor already said that ""now is a good time to get into the market"". They do not know that. This is, at best, an educated opinion, and at worst spitballing. The odds and majority opinion are actually against that statement at the moment, but they could be terribly wrong or terribly right. Nobody can predict the future. Do not act on a reddit prediction. You should be confident in the things you're invested in whether you're down 50% or up 50%, and whether the market is blood red or green as grass. Conversely, you are NOT stupid because the bottom wasn't where you thought it was. You had no way of knowing, and timing the bottom is nearly impossible.

stocks,"Interesting take. Here’s everyone else’s whom have that “half a brain cell”:  

The market being up 90% over five years sounds great… until you remember that includes an unprecedented post-COVID stimulus boom, insane tech stock rallies, and one of the fastest rate hike cycles in decades. That 90% isn’t gradual linear growth—it’s a rollercoaster. And most portfolios aren’t just riding the S&P 500 unbothered.

Also ,, boldly stating that anyone worried about volatility or macroeconomic risk is just “freaking out about Trump and doesn’t like the man or his polices.” I disagree, people are reacting to inflation, Fed policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk - trade wars.

stocks,"You're an investor, Harry. Not a political commentator. I don't know why I'm reading about 2020 and 2008, this is not merely bubbles bursting and markets cycling but is a potential paradigm shift, a potential change in a similar nature to the change after the Second World War.

If anyone is smart and looking to get into investing then it's important to recognise no one here is talking like it. People need to see signal through the noise. Don't be simply a cycle thinker who is thinking ""Markets are down! Buy the dip?"" and are blind to new risks and opportunities, instead see that we may be exiting an era and entering a new one, and that this may be the beginning of the end for overexposed sectors built for the old world, while there can be emerging investment opportunities in previously dull neglected industries, such as regional manufacturing and water security and energy and so on.

This is the time to remind yourself that if you want to be an investor then don't practise being a political commentator. This will be time to do dust off some books, do some deep research, and be the early bird and see the opportunties. I've been retired for a while and not paid attention to markets, and I'm not at all familiar with these online spaces, and perhaps it's very different as there's an influx of casual investors, but the discussions are very disappointing.

What are governments going to be incentivising? What's too strategically important to fail? What will business be trying to secure? We may be about to go from laissez-faire to industrial policy. Talk about European service and tech and defense, talk about American manufacturing, semiconductors, robotics and automation to offset U.S. labour costs, defense and aerospace, vertical integration, agricultural land and water. This can be a new world where you want to be looking at ETF exposure to U.S. manufacturing renaissance while talking about undervalued EU tech firms and digital infrastructure.

And I've been thinking that junk bonds are looking very interesting, it could be a new junk bond golden age. Why buy garbage? Because trash pays. There's much creativity around credit. If you want to go sewer diving it won't be easy business but I have a feeling there's going to be more diamonds down there than not in the coming new world. If there's a clever kid out there who's sick of hearing 'Buy Nvidia' and who can figure this stuff out then in the coming markets junk bonds could the opportunity to become the evil financier billionaire that you were born to be, a mini Oaktree or Apollo. All these tariffs, particulalry targetting China and other major trade partners, and a general breakdown of globalisation and new economic direction, may cause a lot of initial market downturn but the upheaval can result in big yields for risky investments, like junk bonds, as investors look for maximising returns in high-risk low-growth environments.

Heavily indebted U.S. legacy manufacturers and supply chain firms, companies for steel, tools, and construction materials with big debt but strong domestic exposure, legacy equipment rental and logistics firms tied to domestic transport etc, are weak on paper but there could be enormous government incentivisation and reshoring trends, bonds can be priced as if they're dying but with contracts the debt could double. Energy infrastructure and oilfield services have volatile cash flows, big leverage, spooked investors, but with geopolitical energy crises demand can get big. Talk about offshore drilling companies, midstream energy firms, LNG infrastructure. Media and Telecom? A lot of cable companies are loaded up on debt from cheap money era and their stocks and bonds have been hammered but their cash flows are real. And all the emerging markets; commodity exposure and geopolitical alignment means surprising stability. Emerging Market corporate debt is priced with panic but countries who benefit from resource demand can gain a lot of capital flow and influence. Think about commodity-exporting firms and Emerging Market infrastructure companies tied to Belt & Road alternatives and BRICS trade realignment. And when it comes to the likes of U.S. office real estate and China's property sector people may need a hazmat suit, but these sorts of things bonds trading low could rebound very high with restructuring and policy rescue, though that's landmine territory, but if you can figure out explosive ordnance disposal you'd be the king of the jungle, where bonds bleed and yields roar. Make no mistake it won't be the yawn fest of your grandmother's Vanguard ETF drip, it's all Hard Mode, but watch the ICE BofA High Yield OAS, the spread over treasuries.

investing,"I think GFC fundamentally was worse but social media or the speed of which both solid information plus misinformation gets pumped out is significantly different than 08.  Covid demonstrated this pretty well. Reddit was one of the best places to get some facts on Covid before or if even mainstream news would say a thing.  The amount of misinformation on Covid was insane. Governments told their citizens what was most palatable at times.  Often times the most scientific or empirically quantified news hit Reddit first which is actually sad in some ways. 

On Reddit you can literally see well educated economists or financial experts tell it as it is literally forecasting many events we see today. And on various social media you can see tons of misinformation same as during COVID.

This simply wasn’t a phenomenon with the GFC and had it been there who knows what would have resulted really.  I put my head down and just worked and DCA into the crash for 08, and things ended up okay.  Even the Boglehead forum just started around those years btw.  

Social media was also around for the insolvency of FRC.  A bank that didn’t have any extra toxicity in its holdings and balance sheet with wealthy clients that any other bank didn’t similarly have and once absorbed by JPM contributed to leading financial success out of all banks. 

Make no mistake when I weigh in analysis of good or bad I put social media in there with the bad. I learned that with FRC.  So yes current events are bad, probably not fundamentally as bad as GFC, but social media is *not* helping.  Bank runs are a faith based issue as is dedollarization.  I was younger and put my head down in 08 and just grinded, and I cannot afford to do that for my current age and assets today with this spectacle.

investing,"According to some analysts, Trump’s global trade war is part of a broader framework to reorganize global financial and trading systems. The roadmap Trump is following was laid out in November in a 41-page essay written by Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Many have dubbed this the ‘Mar-a-Lago Accord,’ which envisions the U.S. dollar remaining unchallenged as the world’s reserve currency—creating global economic stability—while staying undervalued to support domestic manufacturing and the economy.

Miran also suggested that the U.S. government could sell its gold and use the proceeds to buy other currencies. Selling U.S. gold reserves would also impact the reserves of emerging market central banks, which have been accumulating the precious metal at record rates over the last three years.

Analysts have said it will be difficult for Trump to fulfill the goals of the Mar-a-Lago Accord, as the proposed strategies appear to run counter to one another.

In the near term, Trump’s tariffs are expected to continue driving inflation higher, which will pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain its neutral monetary policy stance, keeping the U.S. dollar elevated.

At the same time, analysts have noted that while the U.S. dollar might eventually weaken, it may take slower economic growth or an outright recession to achieve that outcome.

Commodity analysts have said that global uncertainty and the threat of a recession have fueled gold’s push above $3,000 an ounce, as investors seek a safe-haven asset to hedge against higher inflation and slower growth.

But even at these prices, gold could still move higher. In an interview with Kitco News, Tom Bruce, macro investment strategist at Tanglewood Total Wealth Management, said the market is underestimating the Mar-a-Lago Accord trade.

He added that if Trump achieves his goal, it would be a game-changer for gold in its own right.

“The Mar-a-Lago Accord calls for a weaker U.S. dollar and lower interest rates—this is the perfect environment for gold,” he said. “As it stands, I'm bullish on gold just by looking at the global picture.”

While Trump might achieve his goal, it may not happen the way he expects. The original essay called for global cooperation to redefine trade, but Trump’s import tariffs have sparked a global trade war, and many nations are now looking past any potential U.S. influence.

In recent weeks, the European Union has proposed spending hundreds of billions of euros on defense and infrastructure as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues. Germany has taken the lead, approving a €500 billion spending program to bolster its military and infrastructure.

Some economists note that in this environment, Trump could still achieve his goal of a weaker U.S. dollar. Analysts point out that Europe’s spending initiative has drawn more investment capital into the region, diverting it from the U.S., and that a trillion-euro spending program would be transformative for Europe’s economy.

Last week, [French bank Société Générale reduced its exposure to U.S. equities and the U.S. dollar, favoring the euro and yen. At the same time, it maintained its gold holdings at 7% of its portfolio](https://www.kitco.com/news/article/2025-03-25/socgen-continues-hold-7-its-portfolio-gold-and-sees-path-4000).

The bank expects gold prices to average around $3,300 an ounce in the fourth quarter.

“Gold remains a strong momentum play, in a context where the redefinition of geopolitics under the U.S. administration triggers significant policy reactions,” the analysts said.

Earlier this week, commodity analysts at [Bank of America also upgraded their gold price outlook through 2027 as they expect the U.S. economy to lose its luster.](https://www.kitco.com/news/article/2025-03-26/golds-surge-3000-spurs-bank-america-raise-price-target)

“Uncertainty around Trump Administration trade policies could continue to push the USD lower, further supporting gold prices in the near term,” the analysts said. “Subsiding U.S. exceptionalism and a weaker USD will likely remain bullish factors for gold.”

The analysts at Bank of America expressed doubts that the Trump administration will be able to achieve the goals set out in Miran’s essay. They noted that ‘America First’ could devolve into ‘America Alone,’ while further fueling the ongoing de-dollarization trend among central banks.

“A balanced U.S. current account may require lower capital inflows going forward. If this is accompanied by a shift from ‘America First’ to ‘America Alone,’ central banks may further reduce USD holdings, with gold being a beneficiary,” the analysts said. “Indeed, we believe continued central bank reserve diversification will be a key medium-term gold price driver.”

As the trade war escalates every day, I've been evaluating my investments from the perspective of a worst case scenario situation. I currently hold a substantial portion of my net worth in a U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund by Schwab - SNSXX. This includes a house fund, which will be utilized next summer while being contributed to regularly and 60% of a rollover IRA that I moved to safer assets last year (SNSXX).

In the worst case scenario, which I imagine would be China/Global holders mass liquidating U.S. Treasuries, what could happen to this fund? Is there a potential that this fund ""breaks the buck"", and I could lose a substantial portion of my assets?

I'd just like to hear some thoughts on this. It is nice collecting ""risk free"" income every month while I work toward financial goals, but is it worth the exposure to a quickly collapsing global trade system? 

Schwab does not offer a High Yield Savings Account, hence the reason I hold these assets in what \*should\* be safe funds. However, if there is a risk, no matter how small, that I could these assets lose value, then it may be worth forgoing the interest and holding straight cash.

investing,"When I was younger (but still way older than you when I first started) I played with investments and mostly sucked at it btw my only winning plays early on were Bogleheading and being diligent with contributions and saving as well as tax optimization.  You may wonder why folks that told you to buy yesterday got upvoted when others that tell you not to time the market also get upvoted. 

Fact of the matter is bogleheadedness works for most people especially young students and professionals.  But being level headed and smart about some timing IMO *does* matter.  Also the reality is a lot of folks don’t even go full blown Boglehead and if they did they might even have a muted return depending on their age profile (did you know it’s a boglehead rule of thumb to have your bond allocation match your age?). 

We are having unprecedented times and IMO the reality is the time and investment and stress it takes to time the market would kill your ability to study, work professionally, and build or maintain relationships with people.  I do not believe you should treat investments like roulette or trivia but how insurance treats premiums and policies using actuarial science, probabilities, and weighing risks vs return.  But unless you have a profound want or talent for it don’t bother.  Pick a day to go in with a smart allocation and optimize on taxes like going ROTH for some and having maybe after tax for the house. 

Not that I was an extreme rockstar as a student or my career, I did well enough and honestly didn’t have time to obsess about the market, and did smarter things like go to the gym.  

That said I’m older now (46). I feel a bit lazy or that my career has peaked enough where optimizing on my portfolio actually does seem like an okay alternative to just pushing harder on my career (where when you are young it likely pays off but when older it’s more of a gamble tbh depending on your field).  I’m married to a gorgeous smart wife.  I probably should go to the gym now but mostly don’t. I probably could still be a better husband and father with better time allocation but I do treat investing as a bigger hobby now in my spare time and I have an IT job with work life balance that gives me that spare time. 

I don’t want to treat it like a game, but I admit in a way my brain is wired to always be min maxing so I know the real world dangers and extent of my risk profile.  I have played every single sim game before the dating ones and every single civ and X4 game when younger. I absolutely enjoy optimizing my portfolio and hanging on to S&P beating results. I plan to make more rebalance moves for my portfolio soon given the unprecedented times.  I think someone who rebalances or makes crazy buy sells every week is probably gambling but someone who does a few moves every 1-3 years may just be thoughtful.  I rightfully should be downvoted cause my writing so far looks like it’s trying to convince you to do something the vast majority of folks should not do.  And I would say it’s extremely hard and also relies on luck and it would be far far easier for me to take this long diatribe and sell a book, seminar, podcast to people who will never be as lucky and make money that way than it is for me to continue to actively invest to beat the market.  That’s the absolute truth, it is far easier to sell self help investment books than it is to actively invest and beat the market.  Almost *every* I got successful or lucky in the market or real estate pundit does this. They *know* they got lucky and are leveraging that luck into stable income selling self help!  From Rich Dad Poor Dad Kiyosaki to Dave Ramsay are selling a dream and all of them will outright lie to your face if you were to ask them now how much money did they make off investing vs their actual businesses that sell investment guide books. 

The reality is focusing so heavily on the market right now is more likely to ruin your life, stunt your growth as a student or young professional, or just human being, than it is going to get you rich quick.  That is a good reason to do mosty boglehead strategies.  Hell I would have rathered play sim games and go to the gym when younger than focus on the market.

Given the unpredicibality of the market over the next few years, my financial advisor is advising that I allocate more of my funds to more market-resitant investment vehicles like real estate funds, apartment funds, and QOZs. 

His theory is that the market will continue to get worse. And that even if it bounces back, S&P growth will hardly keep up with inflation over the next decade. Prior to this crash, he was advising a smaller allocation to those funds given the higher expected return from S&P, Vanguard, etc, but now believes the ROI will be similar to these funds in a best case scenario, and higher in a worst case scenario. 

The logic makes sense, however I am skepitcal, given that the apartment funds, etc. will be under his management. 

  
Of course none of us can really predict what will happen, but I am curious if anyone else is asking themselves the same things and has an opinion they'd be open to sharing?

Like many of you, I’ve been thinking a lot about how to handle my finances during this economic downturn. I’m reaching out to get your thoughts on where to park my money for the foreseeable future—hopefully just the short term.

Up until now, I’ve been consistently dollar-cost averaging into the S&P 500 each month, which has been going well. Normally, I’d continue with that strategy since I’m still far from retirement.

About two years ago, my wife and I were fortunate enough to purchase a multi-family home in Queens, NY with an interest rate in the mid-4% range. Given the recent market volatility—and what seems like more uncertainty ahead—I’m considering two possible changes to our current plan:

**Option A:** Lower our monthly investment into the market and redirect that money toward extra mortgage payments.  
**Option B:** Lower our monthly investment and move that money into our high-yield savings account (HYSA), then make a larger lump-sum payment toward the mortgage at the end of the year.

That said, a part of me still thinks I should just stay the course and continue investing into the S&P 500 as usual.

I’d love to hear what you all think. What would you do in this situation?

**This is from a real financial advisor and a life-long friend of mine. This is a wonderful time to make money.**

"" This is all just fear-mongering by the left-wing media. They hate Trump because he’s threatening their control and their money. Right now, America’s news outlets are leaning far left. People are sheep, they'll believe whatever CNBC headlines tell them.

Trump strong-arming this should work. Eventually, China - or whoever retaliates - will realize it’s not worth losing trillions. There will be negotiations, which more likely than not will favor America. America's economy and military are FAR too strong for it to go any other way.

Stocks and Bitcoin should stabilize, then advance. Just like always. Anyone panicking and selling long positions over this is inevitably going to regret doing so.

This is just a blip. Eventually, everyone will wish they’d bought in on “liberation day.” This liberal-led panic sell will die the second we negotiate - or two years max, if China can even hold out that long. I doubt they will. America is their #1 importer.

It should all work out in the end. This song and dance hasn’t changed since 1890 - I doubt it will now.

I should say - the only way this doesn’t work out is if China retaliates militarily. Then you’re looking at 5+ years for new highs on Bitcoin or the S&P, or the destruction of China and potentially multiple countries. I have no guess as to what would unfold if it went nuclear. This scenario is beyond unlikely. Military stock would be the next AI if there is any threat. Amazon would restructure into a defense contractor. Their stock would be invaluable.

https://advisor.morganstanley.com/the-hunter-jacobs-group/documents/field/h/hu/hunter-jacobs-group/DCA_versus_lump_sum_article.pdf


Their conclusion is lump sum outperforms DCA 56% of cases for periods of at least 3 months. Assuming a full market cycle of 7 years. The longer the DCA period the more likely it would underperform but even at 1 year period they show low-60% chance of lump sum outperformance. But also the return differential isn't as significant as you think (we're talking about bps instead of full percentages). You can see everything starting on page 6.

But like I said, I'm not doubting the lump sum is statistically better on average. But DCA is useful to mitigate the initial drawdown risk and the left fat tail. The study also states that DCA makes more sense for behavioral reasons, and when valuations are elevated (like what we've been seeing before this downturn).",comprehensive research done morgan stanley based year data http advisor morganstanley com hunter jacob group document field h hu hunter jacob group dca versus lump sum article pdf conclusion lump sum outperforms dca case period least month assuming full market cycle year longer dca period likely would underperform even year period show low chance lump sum outperformance also return differential significant think talking bps instead full percentage see everything starting page like said doubting lump sum statistically better average dca useful mitigate initial drawdown risk left fat tail study also state dca make sense behavioral reason valuation elevated like seeing downturn,Comment,['MS'],Banks & Finance

investing,"1\] Popular ETFs track diversified indexes.  If you want to follow the S&P 500 (one of the most popular ones) then you can choose from SPY/VOO/FXAIX/SWPPX.  They are different funds that track the same index, offered by different companies (SPDR/Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab).  If one of those matches up with your brokerage, go with that one.  If not, and you can buy any of them, avoid SPY.  It's fine, but it's more geared for people who want high liquidity for things like trading options.  I'm assuming you're not wanting to do options.

Other domestic offerings that can be considered would be things like VTI which is Vanguard's offering for a total stock market ETF.  It essentially invests in all equity companies in the US market.  Going a step further, VT is Vanguard's total world market ETF, so it includes equities world wide.  All of this plays into how much diversification you want.

There are also ETFs for things like bonds.  [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund\_portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) has some listings of different funds they recommend, depending on if you want domestic equities, foreign equities, bonds, etc.

If you actually studied finance or done basic ito calculus on markets itd be readily apparent why looking at things in terms of percentage makes sense. Trying to pretend that a 10 dollar stock is equally likely to increase or decrease price by 20 dollars is insane. What would that even mean? A stock worth -10 dollars? that's the basic implication of looking at things in terms of price change rather than percent. And that's only one small piece of why the mathematical models that underpin all of modern finance operate on percentage change.

investing,"I know a lot of people are freaking out right now about the stock market.  

Moments like this are why the stock market is meant for long term investing.  You can lose money in the short term.  Your emergency fund should not be in the stock market. Moments like this are also why people close to retirement should not be all in on stocks (unless they have another source of income like a pension).  

Selling locks in losses.  In some situations, locking in those losses might be the right plan.  In a lot of situations, holding on to the shares is the wiser strategy. If you have 20+ years until retirement, you have plenty of time for your shares to rebound.  But if you see yourself definitely needing some of the invested money in the next five years, you may want to make a different choice.

Target Date Funds are popular for retirement accounts because they are designed to be less volatile due to their mix of US, international, and bonds.  They also become less risky the closer they get to the expected retirement age.  Right now, VOO is down 15% since the beginning of the year.  Vanguard 2040 is down less than 8% and Vanguard 2060 is down less than 10%.  More conservative options are less volatile.  

VOO and chill is very big on Reddit, but while VOO is down 15%, VXUS is down less than 5%.  You might want to consider the [Bogleheads strategy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) which also has its own subreddit.  If you currently have high risk investments, one option is to let those ride, but change how you invest new money.  Meaning let your VOO position ride while adding in VXUS and BND (or whatever you choose).

Just because a credit card is from a bank doesn't mean you need an account with them. You can pay a Wells Fargo card from a Capital One bank account. I think they use the branding to try and trick you into banking with them.

investing,"SO there are no fabulous prizes other than maybe trying to catch a falling knife but lets put forth our best estimates of where the bottom could be.  If possible be sure to include your reasoning.  Here is my guess:

So the S&P was at 6144 on Feb 19th then we had the first Tariff shock and it sank roughly to 5500 (in part bouncing off 10% correction and then going back to about 5600-5700 range).  At that time Goldman Sachs noted consensus was the tariff announcement in early April would yield about 8% so the market was priced about right going into April 2nd (about 8% down from peak).  Then we had the announcement with a weighted average of about 24% tariff across all trading partners (JP Morgan numbers)  rather that the 8% the market expected.  If it were only that simple then we could reasonably expect the pricing in to be 24% below the 6144 peak or around another 14% down from the 5500 short term bottom before the april 2 announcement.  That number is about S&P 4700. 

BUT the market also now knows atleast some countries / regions will enact tariffs of there own in response although not all will.  This stands to further cause impact but remember they also clearly realize that reprisal tariffs hurt there own companies as much as they hurt the US also, the German, Spanish, Italian finance ministers have even voiced this since the announcement .  SO Im going to guess they take a more modest approach on average across all trading partners.  Im going to guess they do what the market expected the US to do in the first place which is a consensus of 8%.  So that takes 4700 down by another 8% to just around 4300.   If they were to do 10% instead then that would be more like 4200.   The S&P was trading at around 24 P:E on april 2, income will ofcourse dip going forward but the trailing P:E would be reduced to about 18.  It could easily overshoot but im sticking to my guess of **4300** what is everyone elses best guess.",fabulous prize maybe trying catch falling knife let put forth best estimate bottom could possible sure include reasoning guess p feb th first tariff shock sank roughly part bouncing correction going back range time goldman sachs noted consensus tariff announcement early april would yield market priced right going april nd peak announcement weighted average tariff across trading partner jp morgan number rather market expected simple could reasonably expect pricing peak around another short term bottom april announcement number p market also know atleast country region enact tariff response although stand cause impact remember also clearly realize reprisal tariff hurt company much hurt u also german spanish italian finance minister even voiced since announcement im going guess take modest approach average across trading partner im going guess market expected u first place consensus take another around instead would like p trading around p e april income ofcourse dip going forward trailing p e would reduced could easily overshoot im sticking guess everyone el best guess,Body,"['GS', 'SPGI']",Banks & Finance

I have been avoiding investing for a couple of years now because of lack of money, but now i have a lot to spare, and i was wondering if investing in the S&P 500 would be a good call now. 

My living situation is steady as can be, i have a job and decent savings (around 6k$).

My thinking is that the stock market is experiencing a shock due to the tariffs, but i've also seen the S&P 500 being a general profit if you look at the last year or longer. This means from what i've gathered, that now is a good time because the economy will stabilise with time and adjustment.

On the other hand, i have a feeling that the US is on its way out as a leading capitalist nation as China are getting more and more advanced.

investing,"Since last summer, I’ve been posting monthly updates over at a subreddit I created, r/investorinsights, mostly as a way to step back and see the market more clearly.

For a while, those updates were pretty uneventful—because, frankly, the market was behaving. But with all the recent volatility, I think there’s more value in sharing the research I’ve been doing. So I figured I’d post the April update here for anyone who might find it helpful.


**InvestorInsights April 2025 Update**

Market Volatility: A Gut Check, Not a Crisis

The S&P 500 is down quite a bit from its February high, finishing March at 5,811.85. That puts us right back where we were last July—like a roller coaster that forgot how to climb. The Nasdaq Composite has taken an even bigger hit, down 14% since December.

This kind of pullback isn’t new, and it’s not the end of the world. In fact, it’s part of the natural cycle. What's especially notable is the $7 trillion sitting in money market accounts right now. That’s a massive amount of capital sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a clearer signal to re-enter. History suggests much of it eventually will.

If you’re already invested, the best move may be to simply keep going. Timing the market is a losing game.

Economic Signals: A Mixed Bag

There’s plenty of conflicting data out there. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting -0.5% GDP growth for Q1—technically a contraction—while the New York Fed is estimating +2.9%. That’s a massive spread, and it reflects just how uncertain this environment is.

That said, reacting to short-term data with long-term money rarely ends well. A sound financial plan is designed to weather both good quarters and bad ones.

Trucking and Rail: Positive Movement

In more encouraging news, the American Trucking Associations’ Tonnage Index rose 3% in February. Trucking moves over 70% of the goods in the U.S., so when tonnage rises, it's a sign of life. Rail traffic is also up 4.2% year-to-date, with intermodal shipments climbing 8.2%.

That tells us that goods are moving and commerce is flowing—both good signs beneath the market noise.

Housing Market: Under Pressure

The housing sector continues to face challenges. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 39 in March—its lowest in seven months. Builder sentiment is being weighed down by rising material costs (including tariffs that add an estimated $9,200 per home) and ongoing policy uncertainty.

The Northeast is the most resilient region, but elsewhere, construction is slowing. If you’re looking to buy or build, it might be wise to exercise patience.

Inflation: Still Sticky

Inflation remains persistent. Core PCE, the Fed’s preferred metric, was up 2.8% year-over-year in February. Short-term interest rates are now north of 3%, which is starting to bite into borrowing and spending.

But this isn’t a 1970s-style runaway inflation scenario. Prices are still rising, yes—but they’re rising more slowly, and the Fed is keeping a close eye on the trend.

Federal Reserve: Staying the Course

The Fed kept interest rates steady last month at 4.25%–4.5% and is slowing the pace of balance sheet reduction starting in April. This suggests they’re aiming for a “soft landing”—bringing inflation down without tipping the economy into recession.

It’s a tricky balance, but so far, they’re not rocking the boat too much.

Final Word: Stay Disciplined

Headlines will always focus on the drama—but don’t let noise drive your decisions. Downturns are a normal part of investing, and history consistently rewards those who stay the course.

Think of this moment like a sale on high-quality assets. If you’re still in the accumulation phase, market dips aren’t something to fear—they’re opportunities.

Ten years from now, today’s turbulence will be a blip in your rearview mirror. Focus on what you can control: your savings rate, your asset allocation, and your mindset.

investing,"You don't want to buy at the top, yet when the market goes down you miss it because you try to time the bottom. Then you sit on your money losing value to inflation despite being worried about inflation eating your cash.

This is why they keep saying time in the market beats timing the market. The S&P 500 has grown about 10% annually historically, most of the time that growth is coming when the market is already at all time high... it's just that it goes even higher.

You need to evaluate your risk tolerance. If you are in it for the long haul (20+ years), best bet would be to just invest on a regular basis despite what the price is. However, if you have low tolerance for risk then simply for your mental health you can choose a lower risk, lower reward option like a higher percentage of bonds to stocks.

Also if you don't want to go all in you can always put in a few thousand here and there to average out the risk. If you see a particularly red day you can opt to put more in (buy low), but don't let green days put you off either because you fear 'buying high' - as mentioned before, market is basically always at an all time high.

investing," When the S&P 500 drops more than 1.5% on a Friday, it falls again the following Monday 92 out of 94 times.

#### **Analysis:**  
1. **Data Source & Timeframe:**  
   - This claim appears to originate from a **2022 Bloomberg analysis** (though similar stats have circulated for years).  
   - The study likely covered **1950–2022** (S&P 500 history).  

2. **Findings:**  
   - **Out of 94 instances** where the S&P 500 fell >1.5% on a Friday:  
     - **92 times (97.9%)**, it dropped again on Monday.  
     - **Only 2 times**, it rose on Monday.  
   - **Average Monday decline**: **-0.8%** after a bad Friday.  

3. **Possible Explanations:**  
   - **Weekend Effect:** Traders hedge risk before weekends, leading to Monday follow-through.  
   - **Sentiment Spillover:** Bad news over the weekend (e.g., geopolitical events) fuels selling.  
   - **Short-Term Momentum:** Panic selling often continues into the next session.  

4. **Exceptions (The 2/94 Times It Rose):**  
   - **March 2020** (COVID crash rebound).  
   - **October 2008** (post-Lehman volatility).  

#### **Is This Statistic Reliable for Trading?**  
- **Yes, historically**—the pattern holds with ~98% accuracy.  
- **But:**  
  - **No guarantee** it will persist (market dynamics change).  
  - **Small sample size** (only 94 cases in ~70 years).  
  - **Other factors** (Fed policy, earnings, macro news) can override the trend.  

#### **Bottom Line:**  
The stat is **empirically true** based on historical data, but **not a foolproof trading rule**. Use it as a *sentiment indicator*, not a standalone strategy.",p drop friday fall following monday time analysis data source timeframe claim appears originate bloomberg analysis though similar stats circulated year study likely covered p history finding instance p fell friday time dropped monday time rose monday average monday decline bad friday possible explanation weekend effect trader hedge risk weekend leading monday follow sentiment spillover bad news weekend e g geopolitical event fuel selling short term momentum panic selling often continues next session exception time rose march covid crash rebound october post lehman volatility statistic reliable trading yes historically pattern hold accuracy guarantee persist market dynamic change small sample size case year factor fed policy earnings macro news override trend bottom line stat empirically true based historical data foolproof trading rule use sentiment indicator standalone strategy,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

You're going through something a lot of new investors experience, and it's completely understandable to feel stressed. First of all, you didn’t make a mistake by investing—you made a smart long-term decision, even if the short-term results feel discouraging right now.

Your portfolio is down about 15%, which definitely hurts, especially since you waited a long time to take the leap. But the funds you chose—VOO, FXAIX, AVUV, and SCHF—are diversified, well-respected, and historically strong performers over time.

In your list, you didn't mention the effect on bonds and home prices that led presidential advisors to push for suspending tariffs yesterday:

> Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.
>
>Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said. - **[source](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-changed-mind-tariffs-rcna200414)**

Regular DCA is your baseline strategy - this is automatic and never stops. But keeping some cash on the side (like 10-15% of your investment money) lets you be opportunistic when markets tank. I'm not trying to perfectly time anything. I just know that when the S&P drops 15-20%, stocks are objectively cheaper, so I'll put some extra cash to work. That's not really ""timing"" - it's just being prepared for opportunities.

* Regular savings beyond their DCA amount
* Bonus money or tax returns
* Small cash position inside their investment account

I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, let me jump right to the question for you:

Will the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

\---------------------------------------

For those looking for something to read, here you go:

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain.

Here is a great interview with the well-respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those who do not want to watch the whole video, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".

1. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends.

1. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*

1. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.

1. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession.

1. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us).

1. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices.

1. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.

1. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).

1. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business have very long time-cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.

1. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.

1. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. This will cause more market volatility.

1. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view.

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administration’s haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out as being far more likely to be of great benefit to China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR) (\*a lot has changed in the three days since I made this chart/post).

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from its recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen any *real* damage to its share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon!

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised his voters that he would do.

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the rosiest picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself).

If there is real and lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers (Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future) boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow.

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost (and counting). While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time.

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla.

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

There will be face-ripping rallies along the way, but I’d be surprised if the S&P doesn’t bottom out at 3500 or so. Timing the market is extremely difficult 99% of the time - but it was beyond obvious stocks were going to tank 6 weeks ago, when the tariffs were announced (and changed, and changed again) on Mexico and Canada.

investing,"Someone else posted this [link](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/does-market-timing-work) to a market timing study. It's obviously only one study and might oversimplify things. But it seems to suggest the best time to invest in index funds is right when you have the money (so right when you get paid).

I've seen other people comment this on the sub along with ""time in the market beats timing the market"" and say invest lump sums as soon as you have them. This seems to track with this study. If you're asking about DCA then you probably understand you can't time the market consistently over a lifetime of investing.

However, this study surprised me in that it suggests spreading the money out more via DCA achieves slightly lower returns than lump sum. 

DCA does have the benefit that your portfolio will be less subject to volatility. So if you're an emotional trader or worry about panic selling, DCA over shorter frequencies can mitigate that. This might mean spreading your investment from a single paycheck by investing it daily over the two weeks after getting paid.

>Isn't it just the same as trying to predict how long the crash will last?

Depends on how much you're considering the current market when deciding your cadence and investment amounts. But it's still better than holding it all in cash and waiting for the bottom.

To really not ""time the market,"" you could take that out of consideration and just consider your general risk tolerance. If you have low tolerance, you will use a shorter cadence over long time period like daily investments over a couple years. If you have high tolerance, you would consider lump sum all at once, or maybe large monthly investments for a few months.

Buddy of mine from college was in risk management at Morgan Stanley. 

During the turmoil when it appeared that losses would not be contained and that this thing was spiraling out of control, he actually called me and said to run to as many ATMs as I can and withdraw as much cash as possible. Most on reddit these days were probably too young what 2007-2008 was like, either they were kids then or in school, but there was actually a legitimate chance of the entire financial system collapsing due to the implosion of the credit markets. Without credit, everything grinds to a stop. When the movie Margin Call came out, he said it was basically just like that at his department even though that movie was about Lehman.

As far as the housing market....imagine walking outside and 90% of the homes on your block are for sale at -50% off, and still no buyers. And no renters even at $1,000/mo.....for an entire house. Imagine driving by development after development, partially finished and left to rot. That is what the Florida housing market was like then. My coworker at the time, had bought his Florida house for $380,000. He had to quit his job and move back to Florida because he couldn't sell his house at any price and this was before HARP. There were homes on his block he said where sellers were trying to offload for $140,000 and still 0 buyers. These same houses today are in the $650,000 range today....so in 20 yrs the home has appreciated about $40,000 in real terms. That's how inflated the '03-'06 bubble run up was...people think Covid housing bubble was a lot....nothing compared to the 2000's Greenspan created one

He’s right

He’s right. Fire him if you disagree.

No… they’re trying to keep you from making a ruinous financial decision 

> If the tariff war is going to lead to a recession would the news or the experts really tell us before it’s too late?

First, stop reading places like CNBC because it’s all flash and little substance. 

Second, yes, firms like Goldman Sachs are openly predicting a 50% chance of recession at this point.

investing,"Just my best shot at these:

It’s long but I think about this all day…

1. On the one hand, this seems to be panic selling and irrational… buuuut the multiples on the major (large cap at least) indices were absurd to begin with. In a more sane and healthy economy without so many ghost dollars in the system the S&P would make sense somewhere in the upper 3ks to low 4ks, assuming constant earnings, or somewhere in the mid to upper 3ks if we had a sizable drop in earnings.

But we still don’t have this so this still looks like wild panic selling.

If, however trade and spending policy does result in far fewer easy dollars in the global system and a closing of the Triffin dilemma then we would think that that should happen… buuuut that would also strain out foreign markets as liquidity leaves their systems (particularly in Europe,) likely flooding into US markets and pushing up multiples.

The problem is that this is not simply a matter of earnings, this starts to really get at how the dollar moves around the world. Trade surpluses and deficits end up translating into dollar supply and the liquidity that fuels global lending. I tend to expect further drops in the indices and I may buy puts into it for just a couple days or so, but long- run I expect that I will be buying into more equities. 

There are a lot that appear to me to be quite undervalued and especially with a shift in trade flows there are sectors that I believe to be systemically mispriced.

I began nibbling in last week particularly into hard asset sectors, some lending strategies, and some industrials, but I still have my largest allocation to cash ever since I began which I moved to around the beginning of the year. 

Ultimately I tend to trade and invest in a global macro style and focus more on international behavior to determine entry. 

I am already nibbling in, but below 5,000 will likely pick it up quite a bit.

If it ever hit well into the 3ks then I’d be willing to start levering it.

But for now it seems to be that international behavior, the easy availability of dollars internationally and the foreign lending of USD, as well as the state of foreign markets is the best indicator for my own use.

2. Say we truly washed out the massive USD rehypothecation machine from the world… then that should probably be in 3ks by pure valuation assuming constant earnings, but with the international knock- on effects to earnings then probably the upper 2s. Why? I’m just guessing at this point. We really have no idea how much of the system are these dollars. 

However in that scenario foreign debt markets would be so annihilated that foreign capital would have to flock to the U.S. and we could see the S&P up in the 10,000s. If something major happened with the dollar it wouldn’t just vanish capital completely, it would vanish a lot of credit and all the remaining capital would have to seek safety which would be the U.S. since the U.S. has actual treasury bonds behind its system.
But say we default entirely on all outstanding treasury issues and it goes to 0 of par… well then the S&P is either worth infinite money or 0. In that case money wouldn’t exist anymore so we’d probably be pricing it in hard assets.

3. Gold has gone up a lot in the past while to the point where comex and the LBMA couldn’t satisfy delivery of gold futures. T+2 settlement started becoming T+two months. Likely there were either responses to perceived vs actual tariff policy with respect to gold imports or gold just settling for a bit after being bid up enormously by what were most likely substantial institutions.

EDIT -- Fidelity Contrafund FCNTX and American Funds' Growth Fund of America AGTHX are IIRC the two largest actively managed US funds over $100 billion in assets. according to most recent data, Contrafund has 2.19% cash and AGTHX has 1.9%.

Hey all,

I'm considering doing something a bit risky and wanted some honest feedback.

I have a 0% APR credit card with a $10,000 limit and an 18-month promotional period before interest kicks in. I was thinking: what if I invest that $10K into a broad index fund like VOO or SPY?

The logic is that the market *usually* trends up over time, and I could walk away with a few hundred to a few thousand in profit before paying off the card — assuming I sell and repay the balance before the 0% period ends.

Here’s the catch:  
**I'm currently unemployed.** No steady income right now, though I’m working on it. I don’t have any major debt, and I’ve got a small emergency fund — but not enough to cover the full $10K if the market tanks.

Also — does anyone know which **brokerages are safest** when using a credit card for funding? Or is that not even an option? I’ve used Fidelity and Schwab before with bank transfers, but I’m not sure how this would work with a credit card.

I know this is a gamble and not for the faint of heart. But I’ve heard stories of people using 0% cards strategically, and I’m wondering if this could be one of those situations… or just plain reckless given my current status.

**Any thoughts or advice?** Would love to hear from anyone who’s tried something similar.

I said the most basic price action analysis, like, oh, I don't know, the fact that SPY was making marginal new highs, that the last all time high came on low volume. Fed reports coming out bad. The fact that there wasn't a large end of year rally. The list goes on.

None of these things meant that I was automatically going short. But these things tell you that a trend reversal to bearish is more likely; it's a higher probability. But it's still just a probability; it could be wrong. You have to wait for confirmation. That again raises the probability that it's a real move. When I saw SPY poke through the most recent daily trend line and make a new all time high on low volume, I didn't instantly go short. You needed confirmation. That's what differentiates it from picking tops and bottoms. There's a whole lot more, but this is way too long as is.

 The S&P 500 is important; it accounts for roughly 80% of the total market value. It influences other stocks.

investing,"US stocks cratered on Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plunging more than 2,200 points after China stoked trade-war fears and Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of higher inflation and slower growth stemming from tariffs.

The Dow pulled back 5.5% to enter into correction territory. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (GSPC) sank nearly 6%, as the broad-based benchmark capped its worst week since 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.8% to close in bear market territory.

The major averages added to Thursday's $2.5 trillion wipeout after China said it will impose additional tariffs of 34% on all US products from April 10 — matching the extra 34% duties imposed by Trump on Wednesday.

That ramped up investor worries that countries are more likely to retaliate than negotiate, leading to a protracted global trade war.

Investors flocked to government bonds as the 10-year Treasury (TNX) yield fell to 3.9%, nearing its lowest levels since October.

Economists are warning that with tariffs as-is, the risk of a US recession is rising. The monthly jobs report, unusually overshadowed Friday, showed a labor market that held steady ahead of Trump's biggest tariffs. The US added 228,000 jobs in March, beating estimates, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%.

Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Powell for the first time addressed the reality of the tariffs, saying they were ""higher than anticipated."" He said it is ""too soon to say"" what the proper rate path should be. Traders have ramped up bets on interest rate cuts this year to five, as the Fed is expected to set its efforts to cool inflation aside to tackle the bigger risk of economic slowdown.

Trump, posting on Truth Social on Friday, added to fears by saying that his policies ""will never change"" and warning that China ""played it wrong.""

The thing about holding them directly is that you may need to manually reinvest dividend income as it comes in (which, BlackRock and the 0.10% fee aside, is an advantage of the ETF compared to the bond itself -- automatic dividend reinvestment).  Unlike the ETF you can't reinvest directly back into a Treasury bond unless you get enough income to buy them in $1,000 increments where you can't buy fractional bonds, but you could reinvest the interest in something like a TIPS ETF.

investing,"Back-of-the-Napkin Economics (Yeah, cue the eye roll from your first-year calc prof 😅)

 Let’s break this down. 

Imagine a 25% tariff slapped across the board. Consumers don’t suddenly have 25% more money, so demand drops. Corporate sales? Down 25%. Earnings? Also down 25%.

 Now let’s bring in some context. 

Ignore post-2008 P/E ratios (thanks, money printing). From 1971 to 2007, the average S&P 500 P/E ratio was \~19.4. Today? It’s sitting at \~25. 

Now apply that 25% earnings drop and a reversion to historical valuation norms, and boom — you get a potential 42% drop in the S&P from current levels. That’s just basic math. Regression to the mean. 

But here's where it gets spicy: the intangibles. 

* Crumbling consumer confidence
*  Rising unemployment 
* Derivative exposure exceeding 2007 levels 
* Investment firms leveraged 100:1 
* Commercial real estate on life support 

So… are we cooked? Actually, we’re burnt to a crisp.

Remember 2008? The TARP bailout shifted private risk onto public debt. That playbook's being dusted off again — only this time, the scale’s bigger. The debt tied to risk assets is becoming unsustainable, and a massive financial reset seems inevitable. When it comes, expect another TARP — only this time, it’s gonna be a doozy. The game is the same: protect the top.

 Here’s the ugly truth:

Those living paycheck to paycheck can’t afford to play the long game. Those with a few bucks in the bank are going to see those reserves used up to survive and move into survival mode. People's future-focused decisions will be shelved just to get through the week. Meanwhile, the wealthy sit on reserves, wait for the crash, and scoop up assets at fire-sale prices. The majority get crushed under liabilities, unable to participate in the rebound.

 The pie gets smaller — but the slice for the top grows bigger.

 Thus, even if tariffs vanished tomorrow, the trust in global trade is broken. That damage is done. The U.S. economy will likely contract significantly — and stay smaller. But rest assured: those at the top will come out of it with more control, more wealth, and a bigger piece of what's left.

The bond allocation can be as simple as BND or  FBND or if you want a little extra return you can use 50% JPIE and 50% BINC.

That we climbed up to 6000 is kind of unbelievable - we were a very healthy economy in 2017 with S&P at 2500.  If we go into an ugly recession I would think there could be a huge drop given the unusualness of the climb.

I then think back to the dip in late 2018 and then 2020 and how the market did not behave the way I would have expected and there were quick recoveries.  This time feels different but we are really subject to the whims of Trump here so it wouldn’t shock me to see things bounce back on a reversal.

Back-of-the-Napkin Economics (Yeah, cue the eye roll from your first-year calc prof 😅)

 Let’s break this down. 

Imagine a 25% tariff slapped across the board. Consumers don’t suddenly have 25% more money, so demand drops. Corporate sales? Down 25%. Earnings? Also down 25%.

 Now let’s bring in some context. 

Ignore post-2008 P/E ratios (thanks, money printing). From 1971 to 2007, the average S&P 500 P/E ratio was \~19.4. Today? It’s sitting at \~25. 

Now apply that 25% earnings drop and a reversion to historical valuation norms, and boom — you get a potential 42% drop in the S&P from current levels. That’s just basic math. Regression to the mean. 

But here's where it gets spicy: the intangibles. 

* Crumbling consumer confidence
*  Rising unemployment 
* Derivative exposure exceeding 2007 levels 
* Investment firms leveraged 100:1 
* Commercial real estate on life support 

So… are we cooked? Actually, we’re burnt to a crisp.

Remember 2008? The TARP bailout shifted private risk onto public debt. That playbook's being dusted off again — only this time, the scale’s bigger. The debt tied to risk assets is becoming unsustainable, and a massive financial reset seems inevitable. When it comes, expect another TARP — only this time, it’s gonna be a doozy. The game is the same: protect the top.

 Here’s the ugly truth:

Those living paycheck to paycheck can’t afford to play the long game. Those with a few bucks in the bank are going to see those reserves used up to survive and move into survival mode. People's future-focused decisions will be shelved just to get through the week. Meanwhile, the wealthy sit on reserves, wait for the crash, and scoop up assets at fire-sale prices. The majority get crushed under liabilities, unable to participate in the rebound.

 The pie gets smaller — but the slice for the top grows bigger.

 Thus, even if tariffs vanished tomorrow, the trust in global trade is broken. That damage is done. The U.S. economy will likely contract significantly — and stay smaller. But rest assured: those at the top will come out of it with more control, more wealth, and a bigger piece of what's left.

 Same playbook. Same outcome. Every time.",gonna love back napkin economics yeah cue eye roll first year calc prof let break imagine tariff slapped across board consumer suddenly money demand drop corporate sale earnings also let bring context ignore post p e ratio thanks money printing average p p e ratio today sitting apply earnings drop reversion historical valuation norm boom get potential drop p current level basic math regression mean get spicy intangible crumbling consumer confidence rising unemployment derivative exposure exceeding level investment firm leveraged commercial real estate life support cooked actually burnt crisp remember tarp bailout shifted private risk onto public debt playbook dusted time scale bigger debt tied risk asset becoming unsustainable massive financial reset seems inevitable come expect another tarp time gonna doozy game protect top ugly truth living paycheck paycheck afford play long game buck bank going see reserve used survive move survival mode people future focused decision shelved get week meanwhile wealthy sit reserve wait crash scoop asset fire sale price majority get crushed liability unable participate rebound pie get smaller slice top grows bigger thus even tariff vanished tomorrow trust global trade broken damage done u economy likely contract significantly stay smaller rest assured top come control wealth bigger piece left playbook outcome every time,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

Also correcting the statement by the other responder:  
  
By buying long options (not short selling them) without leverage you cannot go negative.  
Only by shorting stocks or options can you go negative and need a margin account.

investing,"The response I see most often is that this is based on population growth, especially in the US, since we have a very interesting lever other countries don't (or at least, not as much) which is immigration. Basically, open the doors a bit more, let in more folks, add more to the GDP, etc. I could get behind that, but I don't think it's a *given*. 

So if you believe in the ""always goes up eventually"" mantra, DCA right now, sure. But why is the fundamental assumption true for you? Or, is there another one I'm missing? 

I guess the pushback here is obvious, it's just a question of how likely you think it is: current policies become more restrictive/extended -> the US is no longer a desirable destination for economic immigrants -> population growth and GDP slows -> line doesn't always go up. I realize this is overly simplistic, but to me so is the assumption that we can sit back on population growth as assurance that eventually, the overall market always goes up and to the right. 

As I'm writing this, maybe one pushback to my pushback is that sure, this net influx may decrease, but the market for US goods abroad will still increase over time. Though that's worth challenging as well: several factors could impact global population rise and certainly global disposable income.

investing,"It's not a given. But the US has had a unique set of factors that have led to it being a particularly good investment over its entire history--not without the occasional bumps though:  
  
\--Good geography; defensible with plentiful natural resources  
\--English common law and patent law, encouraging innovation  
\--Low corporate taxes and relatively unobtrusive Federal government  
\--Relative political stability (i.e. no invasions, civil wars, succession wars, ethnic cleansing, sectarian violence in a long time)  
\--Young and diverse workforce with a lot of immigration (both legal and illegal)  
\--Culture of 'democratic' capitalism (a large fraction of the population has some share of the means of production)  
\--Friendly toward foreign investment

Obviously claiming the US has political stability seems silly right now, but compared to most of the world (and most of world history), it really is quite stable. Of course, so are several other countries, it's not a uniquely US thing. 

Other countries have some of these advantages, or others--so it's not like the US is the only argument for 'line always goes up'. But if you contrast the US with China, for example, the relatively recent Cultural Revolution and earlier civil war make it generally regarded as a less 'safe' investment, particularly when companies can be nationalized at any moment and its financial leaders can disappear for years (e.g. Jack Ma). 

But perhaps the better argument is: what's the alternative? The whole purpose of investing is to become financially independent, presumably to retire at some point. If you really believe the line will eventually go down, then you basically believe you should work until you die. You can do that, sure.

Scientists and tech workers are not leaving in any meaningful amount. The US is still the best place for those types of jobs. I also doubt the H1B visa programs that import tech and other high skilled labor will be affected long term because of how powerful the tech lobby is, and there will never be a shortage of high skilled labor wanting to enter the US.

You undermine your point however, because your gain from timing does not stop when the S&P gets back to 6,100.  If you only do it that once, your gain compounds in perpetuity.

You started with $100,000.  Yesterday you had $83,180

Start today with $83,180, in 30 years at 7%/yr you have $633,187.

Now let's say you sold S&P 6100 and bought back at 5074.

So you started today with $100,000 instead of $83,180

investing,"For the most part I agree with you, but one flaw in your logic here is that you don't need to be perfect to gain from a ""time the market"" strategy.  You don't even necessarily need to be even in the ballpark.  Take 2007 for instance...there was talk of unsustainable housing prices and a housing bubble throughout practically all of 2006.  You could have sold in February 2006 (\~1278 S&P 500), missed all of 2006, had the crash happen, missed the first 6 months of stock market recovery, and STILL ended up better buying back in around July 2009 @ \~915 S&P 500.

Every time I see one of these posts on market timing, they assume absolute precision on timing.  And you just don't need that.  Precision within 9-12 months is normally good enough for a net gain, or at least a breakeven.

That said, I do believe full pullouts are a bad idea.  Instead, you should be rebalancing your portfolio based on risk and valuation -- effectively what Buffet does.  Everyone knew valuations were stupid high at the start of the year.  Hell, people knew it at the start of *last* year.  And again, you could have gotten out in February 2024, and you wouldn't be that far off from where the market is now...

I haven't run the numbers on how where you would end up, but I feel like a strategy like ""X percent stocks / Y percent bonds"", where X = ""15 / Total Stock Market PE"" is perfectly reasonable.",part agree one flaw logic need perfect gain time market strategy even necessarily need even ballpark take instance talk unsustainable housing price housing bubble throughout practically could sold february p missed crash happen missed first month stock market recovery still ended better buying back around july p every time see one post market timing assume absolute precision timing need precision within month normally good enough net gain least breakeven said believe full pullout bad idea instead rebalancing portfolio based risk valuation effectively buffet everyone knew valuation stupid high start year hell people knew start last year could gotten february far market run number would end feel like strategy like x percent stock percent bond x total stock market pe perfectly reasonable,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

stockmarket,"It’s great that you’re getting started with investing, especially with a long-term mindset. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is a solid choice for a beginner looking to build wealth steadily over time, as it provides exposure to a broad market index and has historically delivered strong returns over the long run. Given the current market volatility, here are a few things to consider:

\-       **Continue Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):** You’re already practicing dollar-cost averaging (DCA) by investing $50 weekly. This strategy is fantastic, especially during volatile times. It helps you avoid trying to time the market and ensures you're purchasing more shares when prices are lower and fewer when they’re higher, leading to an average cost over time that smooths out market fluctuations.

\-       **Stick to Your Plan:** Since you’re playing the long game, staying committed to your investment strategy is key. Historically, the stock market has gone through many periods of volatility, but it has consistently trended upward over the long term. Staying invested rather than trying to time the market will likely benefit you more as you’re building your portfolio with consistent contributions.

\-       **Market Volatility as an Opportunity:** In times of market volatility, it can feel unsettling, but remember that volatility often presents buying opportunities, especially for long-term investors. If you keep investing through these fluctuations, you’ll likely benefit when the market recovers. You’ve already committed to the long-term approach, so consider staying the course.

\-       **Consider Diversification:** The SPY ETF is a great foundation as it’s diversified across many sectors of the economy, but as your portfolio grows, you might want to diversify further. You can consider allocating funds into other types of assets or sectors (e.g., bonds, international stocks, or thematic investments) to reduce risk and increase the potential for higher returns as you get more comfortable with your investment journey.

\-       **Review Regularly, but Don’t Panic:** Keep track of your portfolio, but don’t make impulsive decisions based on short-term volatility. It’s normal to see fluctuations, but over time, these can become less impactful if you stay focused on your long-term goals. If you’re unsure about market conditions, you can always consult with a financial advisor.

In summary, **keep investing weekly**, and don’t let short-term market movements sway you. Your commitment to long-term growth is the best approach, and with time, you should see the benefits of your consistency. Good luck with your investing journey! It sounds like you’re on the right track.",great getting started investing especially long term mindset spdr p etf spy solid choice beginner looking build wealth steadily time provides exposure broad market index historically delivered strong return long run given current market volatility thing consider continue dollar cost averaging dca already practicing dollar cost averaging dca investing weekly strategy fantastic especially volatile time help avoid trying time market ensures purchasing share price lower fewer higher leading average cost time smooth market fluctuation stick plan since playing long game staying committed investment strategy key historically stock market gone many period volatility consistently trended upward long term staying invested rather trying time market likely benefit building portfolio consistent contribution market volatility opportunity time market volatility feel unsettling remember volatility often present buying opportunity especially long term investor keep investing fluctuation likely benefit market recovers already committed long term approach consider staying course consider diversification spy etf great foundation diversified across many sector economy portfolio grows might want diversify consider allocating fund type asset sector e g bond international stock thematic investment reduce risk increase potential higher return get comfortable investment journey review regularly panic keep track portfolio make impulsive decision based short term volatility normal see fluctuation time become le impactful stay focused long term goal unsure market condition always consult financial advisor summary keep investing weekly let short term market movement sway commitment long term growth best approach time see benefit consistency good luck investing journey sound like right track,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
stockmarket,"It's great that you're getting into investing early, and you’re on the right track by thinking about how to navigate this market dip!

**Market timing is tough.** The ""buy low, sell high"" strategy sounds simple, but timing the market can be really tricky. While it’s tempting to buy when stocks are down, it’s important to remember that markets can stay volatile for a while, and prices can keep moving in both directions. **Diversification is key.** While stocks like Google, Amazon, and American Express are well-established, they can still be risky, especially in volatile markets. By looking at broad ETFs like VOO or QQQM, you’re already considering a more diversified approach. They give you exposure to the whole S&P 500 or Nasdaq, which can help reduce risk, especially for someone starting out like you. **Then there’s Risk vs. Reward.** High-growth stocks like Google and Amazon may offer higher returns, but they also come with higher risk. If you want to be more conservative, ETFs like VOO or QQQM might suit you better, even though the returns might not be as high in the short term. But remember, long-term investments in broad indexes often outperform individual stocks in the long run because of their diversity. Lastly, if you're worried about timing the market, consider **dollar-cost averaging (DCA).** This means investing a fixed amount regularly (like monthly) regardless of market conditions. This strategy helps smooth out the impact of volatility and lowers the risk of making a large investment at the wrong time.

Overall, it’s great that you're thinking strategically. Starting with a diversified approach like VOO or QQQM might be the safest way to build wealth over time, and then you can add individual stocks as you gain more experience.

Dear Xi, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'  
I tweeted, DM’d, and I even faxed Mar-a-Lago callin'  
I left my cell, my office line, and my TruthSocial too  
I sent you gold-plated cufflinks and a MAGA hat, it's true

I know you're busy running China, that’s impressive stuff  
But I’m just sayin', we could be tremendous — friends, not tough  
I saw your speech on state TV, it was total class  
You really own the room — I like that, you're built to last

Anyway, I hope this letter finds you great and strong  
I know the media lies, they always do me wrong  
But I respect your borders, even said Taiwan's ""meh""  
Just call me back, okay?  
Sincerely yours, the real Don J.

I think of deals, I think of walls, I think we might  
Be two great leaders, powerful and wise

Why won't you reply?

Dear Mr. ""I run the world and don’t return a call,""  
This is the second time I’m writin' you — now I’m kinda appalled  
I’m not mad, just confused — we had a vibe, remember?  
You said “beautiful chocolate cake” back in that dinner in November

I told you tariffs were negotiable — I was bluffin’  
But now you're ghostin’ like I’m Sleepy Joe or somethin’  
I know you got tech and TikTok and billion-dollar trains  
But I had The Apprentice and steaks that bear my name

I praised you, said you’re strong, smarter than the rest  
Even called you ""king forever"" (which I meant as a jest)  
So why the cold shoulder? What happened to the charm?  
This silence hurts more than losing Twitter from my palm

Dear Xi… this the last time I try  
I saw you meeting Macron — what a slap, what a lie  
You're out there shakin' hands, while I'm stuck in the rain  
I even invited you to Bedminster — what more can I explain?

Remember North Korea? I solved it, kinda, right?  
And you? You gave me nothing but radio silence overnight  
I’m the Art of the Deal — you know how real I keep it  
But you’ve been colder than my Diet Coke, and I can’t believe it

Maybe it’s the balloon thing, the spy stuff, okay  
But I let Putin slide for years, thought you'd do the same way  
Anyway, this letter’s goin' straight to the archives  
If you ever change your mind — Mar-a-Lago’s got five bars, all Wi-Fi

P.S. – Tell the pandas I said hi.

**Outro – Xi (calm, delayed reply)\]**  
Dear Mr. Trump, I just got back, been out the grid  
Brokering deals, making moves, running this biz  
I saw your notes — quite… passionate, indeed  
But diplomacy requires more than just tweets and need

We may talk in time — until then, stay calm  
Maybe take up golf or drop another bomb

stockmarket,"On February 4, 2025, CNBC reported that the U.S.-China trade war is set to escalate further, with JPMorgan warning that “the bar is too high for truce.” But what’s behind this growing tension?

According to Stephen Miran, a former Treasury official and current economic advisor to Trump’s 2024 campaign, the U.S. has put forward an explosive proposal: China should deposit a portion of its dollar reserves into an escrow account controlled by the U.S. This fund would act as collateral to guarantee that China adheres to trade agreements.

However, the proposal’s details reveal why this is a nonstarter for China. Under the plan, Washington would control the account and have sole authority to decide whether China has met its obligations. Effectively, the U.S. could freeze or withhold the funds at its discretion, based on its interpretation of China’s compliance.

For Beijing, the proposal isn’t just a financial issue — it’s a matter of sovereignty. It’s a financial arrangement that could allow the U.S. to renege on its obligations without officially defaulting, all while presenting itself as simply enforcing trade terms.

Beijing, aware of the political risks, has chosen to keep the proposal hidden from the public to avoid backlash from nationalist factions. Chinese authorities know that if the people were made aware, it would fuel widespread opposition.

The silence from China, it turns out, is part of a larger strategy. Avoiding any public confrontation allows Beijing to resist the proposal without triggering the anger of its citizens.",february cnbc reported u china trade war set escalate jpmorgan warning bar high truce behind growing tension according stephen miran former treasury official current economic advisor trump campaign u put forward explosive proposal china deposit portion dollar reserve escrow account controlled u fund would act collateral guarantee china adheres trade agreement however proposal detail reveal nonstarter china plan washington would control account sole authority decide whether china met obligation effectively u could freeze withhold fund discretion based interpretation china compliance beijing proposal financial issue matter sovereignty financial arrangement could allow u renege obligation without officially defaulting presenting simply enforcing trade term beijing aware political risk chosen keep proposal hidden public avoid backlash nationalist faction chinese authority know people made aware would fuel widespread opposition silence china turn part larger strategy avoiding public confrontation allows beijing resist proposal without triggering anger citizen,Body,['JPM'],Banks & Finance

stockmarket,"Today's move higher in the 10Y yield, the fall in the dollar, and the movement in ""stable value funds"" which have notional (NAV) values that should track flat are telling us that liquidity is rushing out of the system at a breakneck pace.

Amid that, we continue to see CDS spreads gap on major banks in the US and EU and the DOW falls at record pace any time there is meaningful volume. All of the Dow and S&P's ""green mirages"" have been fueled by low volume and the second we see a significant block trade or two, the VIX goes through the roof and the DOW falls 1000+ points.

I think there are systemic issues. I think these will be exacerbated by grid-sensitive industries being impacted by these 145% tariffs. Take the HVAC industry, for instance. It is going to be one difficult summer for Americans (and maybe nursing homes and schools...) when they see that their Chinese-made unit is now so expensive that the supply chains for replacement parts, new units and even the filters have collapsed due to the cost upstream players would need to front just to retrieve the products from port. That's compounded again by the current shift away from 410 refrigerants to 454. The refrigerant to keep your schools, hospitals, nursing homes, offices and houses cool has doubled in price even without tariffs...

Global markets experienced a significant sell-off on April 10, 2025:

* **S&P 500 Futures (ES=F)**: Closed at 5,298.00, down 3.78% from 5,506.25 on April 9.
* **Dow Jones Futures (YM=F)**: Dropped to 39,760.00 from 40,891.00, a 2.77% decline.
* **VIX (\^VIX)**: Surged to 43.99 from 32.92, a 33.63% increase, indicating heightened volatility.
* **Shanghai Composite (000001.SS)**: Bucked the trend, rising 1.16% to 3,223.64.

Sector performance reflected this bearish sentiment:

* **Technology**: Declines of 4-7% (e.g., NVDA -5.91%, META -6.74%, AAPL -4.24%).
* **Energy**: Sharp drops (e.g., XOM -5.55%, CVX -7.57%).
* **Consumer Cyclical**: Notable losses (e.g., TSLA -7.27%).
* **Healthcare**: Mixed results (e.g., UNH +2.75%, LLY -4.35%).
* **Financial Services**: Broad declines (e.g., JPM -3.09%, BAC -3.50%).

This volatile market environment, possibly driven by macroeconomic factors like tariffs or economic data, sets the stage for interpreting insider trading activity over the updated 12-hour window.

# Insider Trading Activity (Last 12 Hours: 06:30 PDT to 18:30 PDT)

Below is a detailed breakdown of key insider transactions within the last 12 hours, organized by sector, with implications tied to market and sector performance. The updated time frame (shifted from 1:00 PM EST, or 10:00 AM PDT, to 18:30 PDT) potentially includes additional transactions up to 18:30 PDT.

# Technology Sector

* **Market Performance**: The sector saw significant declines, with major stocks like NVDA (-5.91%), META (-6.74%), and AAPL (-4.24%) reflecting broad selling pressure.
* **Insider Activity**:
   * **Phreesia (PHR)**: Multiple executives sold shares:
      * CEO Chaim Indig: Sold $290,218.
      * SVP David Linetsky: Sold $99,990.
      * COO Evan Roberts: Sold $172,527.
      * General Counsel Allison Hoffman: Sold $252,777.
      * CFO Balaji Gandhi: Sold $191,895.
      * **Total**: Approximately $1.16 million.
      * **Note**: While web results mention a CFO sale on March 29, 2025 (outside our window), these transactions are assumed to fall within the last 12 hours based on the provided data.
      * **Implication**: Coordinated sales by top executives suggest caution, possibly due to sector headwinds or company-specific concerns.
   * **Cloudflare (NET)**: CEO Matthew Prince sold $249,015 and an additional $16 million in stock:
      * **Total**: Approximately $16.25 million.
      * **Implication**: This substantial sale could indicate profit-taking or unease about further sector declines, though it may also reflect a pre-planned trading schedule.
   * **Asana (ASAN)**: CEO Dustin Moskovitz bought shares in two transactions:
      * $6.7 million and $6.72 million.
      * **Total**: Approximately $13.42 million.
      * **Implication**: This significant purchase signals strong confidence in Asana’s future, viewing the sector’s sell-off as a buying opportunity.

# Energy Sector

* **Market Performance**: Energy stocks declined sharply (e.g., XOM -5.55%, CVX -7.57%).
* **Insider Activity**:
   * **CVR Energy (CVI)**: Activist investor Carl Icahn acquired 665,449 shares from April 8 to April 10, 2025, totaling approximately $11.1 million:
      * **Specific to April 10**: The portion of this purchase on April 10 falls within the 12-hour window (exact breakdown unspecified but confirmed active on this date per web results).
      * **Context**: CVR Energy’s stock has dropped over 50% in the past year, positioning it as a potential value play.
      * **Implication**: Icahn’s contrarian buy suggests he sees upside potential, possibly anticipating a sector recovery or company-specific catalysts.

# Consumer Cyclical Sector

* **Market Performance**: The sector weakened, with stocks like TSLA declining 7.27%.
* **Insider Activity**:
   * **Rush Street Interactive (RSI)**: Multiple insiders sold shares:
      * CEO Richard Schwartz: Sold $2.06 million.
      * CIO Einar Roosileht: Sold $111,600.
      * COO Mattias Stetz: Sold $14,676.
      * **Total**: Approximately $2.19 million.
      * **Implication**: These sales align with sector struggles, potentially reflecting concerns about consumer spending or industry-specific risks.

# Other Notable Transactions

* **Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO) - Communication Services**: Insider Arturo Moreno bought $1.73 million:
   * **Implication**: Optimism about advertising recovery or company growth amid sector declines (e.g., META -6.74%).
* **Gamestop (GME) - Consumer Cyclical**: Director Alain Attal bought $257,500:
   * **Implication**: Suggests belief in a potential rebound or undervaluation.
* **RenovoRx (RNXT) - Healthcare**: VP Controller Ronald Kocak and CMO Agah Ramtin bought shares totaling \~$34,399:
   * **Implication**: Modest buys in a smaller-cap biotech indicate confidence amid mixed sector performance.

# Key Insights and Implications

1. **Technology Sector**: Mixed signals emerge, with significant sells at Phreesia and Cloudflare indicating caution, contrasted by Asana’s large buy suggesting selective optimism. The sector’s 4-7% declines may reflect valuation concerns or macroeconomic pressures, but Asana’s CEO sees value.
2. **Energy Sector**: Icahn’s $11.1 million purchase of CVR Energy stock (partially on April 10) is a standout contrarian move. With the sector down sharply and CVR Energy off 50% in the past year, this buy could signal a bet on recovery or activist strategy.
3. **Consumer Cyclical Sector**: Insider sales at Rush Street Interactive reinforce the sector’s weakness, hinting at worries about consumer demand or competitive pressures.
4. **Extended Time Window**: Shifting from 10:00 AM PDT (1:00 PM EST) to 18:30 PDT extends the analysis by 8.5 hours, potentially capturing more transactions. For instance, Icahn’s April 10 purchase is confirmed within this period, while earlier transactions (e.g., “16 minutes ago” from 13:00 PDT) remain relevant if within the 06:30-18:30 PDT range.
5. **Volatility Context**: The VIX at 43.99 highlights market uncertainty. Sells in struggling sectors may reflect risk aversion, while buys could indicate insiders exploiting perceived overreactions.

# Conclusion

As of 18:30 PDT on April 10, 2025, insider trading activity over the last 12 hours reveals a cautious stance in Technology and Consumer Cyclical sectors, with significant sells at Phreesia, Cloudflare, and Rush Street Interactive aligning with their sectors’ poor performance.

stockmarket,"TLDR

The 10 biggest one-day gains in S&P 500 history all happened during bear markets or major crises. Not one marked the start of a stable recovery. April 9, 2025 (+9.5%) fits that same pattern.

——

All of the biggest gain days in S&P 500 history happened during bear markets.

People get hyped when the market rips 5–10% in a day. But historically, these rallies haven’t marked recoveries. Instead, they’ve happened right in the middle of collapses.

Here are the top 10 single-day gainers in S&P 500 history before April 9, 2025 (+9.5%):

• Mar 15, 1933: +16.6% — Great Depression

• Oct 6, 1931: +12.4% — Great Depression

• Oct 13, 2008: +11.6% — Global Financial Crisis

• Oct 28, 2008: +10.8% — Global Financial Crisis

• Mar 13, 2020: +9.3% — COVID crash

• Mar 24, 2020: +9.4% — Day after the COVID bottom, still peak volatility

• Nov 13, 2008: +6.9% — Still deep in the GFC

• Apr 6, 2009: +6.4% — Just after the GFC low

• Mar 10, 2009: +6.4% — Day after the bottom, still uncertain

• Mar 26, 2020: +6.2% — COVID bear market rally

Every single one occurred during a bear market or extreme crisis. Not one came during a stable bull run or confirmed recovery.

Now add April 9, 2025: +9.5% to the list. It checks all the same boxes.

So if a big green day has you thinking “the bottom is in”. Just remember, history suggests otherwise. These moves don’t scream recovery. They scream instability.

stockmarket,"I am long only and do not trade, but hear me out.

I think today's extraordinary rally was akin to a bear market bounce, it will be faded soon, and fair value of the S&P 500 is a *lot* lower. 

What happened today was nice, but is it that significant?  

Our three biggest trading partners are Mexico, Canada, and China (in that order). Today did **nothing** good for any of those partners. Indeed, it made tariffs so high with China that trade will likely cease entirely for most products. Likewise, even for those less important trading partners, this is merely a 90-day (one-quarter) reprieve of half of the 20% rate from April 2; it **still** leaves 10% active.

Forward EPS estimates of the S&P 500 at the beginning of 2025 were about $265. Most analysts, however, say that for every 10% of tariffs, we can expect about 5% reduction to forward EPS estimates. So, at a bare minimum, if 10% stays for the year we're talking adjusted EPS of $240 ($240 x 19 = 4,560 on the S&P 500), but that ignores China. No one knows what EPS estimates would look like if you exclude trade with China.

So I haven't a clue what the actual fair value is because we have essentially killed trade with China and severely impacted trade with Mexico and Canada, our two top trading partners.

Does anyone else want to guess at how EPS will be impacted by the current nonsense?",long trade hear think today extraordinary rally akin bear market bounce faded soon fair value p lot lower happened today nice significant three biggest trading partner mexico canada china order today nothing good partner indeed made tariff high china trade likely cease entirely product likewise even le important trading partner merely day one quarter reprieve half rate april still leaf active forward eps estimate p beginning analyst however say every tariff expect reduction forward eps estimate bare minimum stay year talking adjusted eps x p ignores china one know eps estimate would look like exclude trade china clue actual fair value essentially killed trade china severely impacted trade mexico canada two top trading partner anyone else want guess eps impacted current nonsense,Body,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

\* EPS will probably drop due to tariffs (or the possibility of tariffs). This will definitely be a drag on stock price but...

\* current valuations are more based on vibes that AI will pay off at some vague time in the future (as opposed to expected earnings next year).

stockmarket,"Markets tend to make double tops with bearish momentum indicators at significant topping points in the intermediate to longer term time period. It registers a higher price with momentum not as strong at the peak as the first top. We hit a high last at 6167 S&P and there is a measured move indicating the mid6300's for a final upside target. If that were to occur quickly and spike back down, there would be a low peak on RSI and Stochastics, indicating bearish momentum divergence of a double top formation. Then the make could make its way back down again as all the bullish money would then be spent and vanquished.

Now what would the fundamental cause of the rally be ? My guess is a Fed rate cut would have to be part of the mix. More corporate buybacks at what are deemed to be discounted prices, and other seasonal liquidity factors would be alternate reasons. Recall that in 2007, the market took a plunge when the mortgage market first sounded the alarm in August that something was desperately wrong in the securitization process. But after that brief downturn, stocks went back to rallying into November, when the equity market finally ran out of gas and proceeded to drop sharply for the next year and a half.

I'll say one other point. I think that this tariff regime and the re-shoring of manufacturing in America is perhaps the best move evert taken on behalf of the American economy. It corrects a lethal flaw that allowed us to relinquish one of the greatest industrial enterprises ever created, all so that a small percentile of managers of the factors of production could gain higher profits at government expense of having to support our displaced workers. It killed the heart of the middleclass of the American economy which was the determinant group for our economic strength. Aside from the tech industry, which was in some ways our only significant manufacturing industry left, it turned us into a rentier service economy that was held hostage for the products we need but no longer made. It enriched the exporting countries that sold to us,  and made us less wealthy. That thirty year attempt at economic suicide now will be stopped and in its place will emerge an economy that is the most productive and profitable economy ever. Americans making products for themselves by themselves. And using the savings of cutting out the middleman to pay off the debt that was bound to eat us alive.

I know there aren't many people who subscribe to this view because they are watching mainly foreign capital leave the US as the quid pro quo of foreign countries and companies being allowed to sell their products to their hearts' content as long as they reinvest some of their profits here is breaking apart. But I caution people to remember that its only been not even a week since the policy was announced, Its beneficial ramifications have not been considered, resulting in the fall of dollar-based markets. But when enough analysts have looked at this plan closely, my bet is many of them will realize how good this policy change will be for the US in the future, and vote with their money to put their customers money to good work.",market tend make double top bearish momentum indicator significant topping point intermediate longer term time period register higher price momentum strong peak first top hit high last p measured move indicating mid final upside target occur quickly spike back would low peak rsi stochastics indicating bearish momentum divergence double top formation make could make way back bullish money would spent vanquished would fundamental cause rally guess fed rate cut would part mix corporate buyback deemed discounted price seasonal liquidity factor would alternate reason recall market took plunge mortgage market first sounded alarm august something desperately wrong securitization process brief downturn stock went back rallying november equity market finally ran gas proceeded drop sharply next year half say one point think tariff regime shoring manufacturing america perhaps best move evert taken behalf american economy corrects lethal flaw allowed u relinquish one greatest industrial enterprise ever created small percentile manager factor production could gain higher profit government expense support displaced worker killed heart middleclass american economy determinant group economic strength aside tech industry way significant manufacturing industry left turned u rentier service economy held hostage product need longer made enriched exporting country sold u made u le wealthy thirty year attempt economic suicide stopped place emerge economy productive profitable economy ever american making product using saving cutting middleman pay debt bound eat u alive know many people subscribe view watching mainly foreign capital leave u quid pro quo foreign country company allowed sell product heart content long reinvest profit breaking apart caution people remember even week since policy announced beneficial ramification considered resulting fall dollar based market enough analyst looked plan closely bet many realize good policy change u future vote money put customer money good work,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

stockmarket,"Know? No. But you can guess: 

Looking at S&P, it seems that a lot of people are trying to buy the dip at around 5000 points. It keeps seesawing there. If it will break through remains to be seen.

The tarrifs are now reaching the point of being incredulous. If they now say ""1000%"" tarrifs, the market wouldnt change much either, because its silly, and how can you break something thats already broken? Above that, if the tarrifs become so high so fast, it means a resolution will come quickly as well, as neither party has the staying power or desire to keep these ridiculous percentages up for 10 years. Its either a bluff from both sides for the masses, or it will cause a complete collapse of the world markets.

Misunderstanding: a lot of people thing the EU tarrifs that leaked today are a light response. It is, because its still about the initial tarrifs on aluminium and steel. The response to the flat 20% is still to come. 

So, lets look at this picture from the perspective of a big boy. To be safe, you do your risk analysis, deem the chance of a complete collapse before either party backs down a risk of 10-20%. You start to diversify more. Maybe in gold, yen, francs or euros. But for the big players to move that much capital away from the dollar takes a couple of months. 

You start moving 10-20% of your portfolio from risky assets like stocks and, believe it or not, US bonds, to safer havens. We are talking trillions here so it takes a week or 2 for everybody to have moved their stuff. You do it gently, deliberately. 

Meanwhile, a bunch of moron retail investers saw a Trump tweet and are chomping at the bit to buy your shitty stocks. Great. Ease down on sales, because you still need to sell 30 billion worth, and you'd rather sell it slowly for 5000 per share, than quickly for 3000.

He just straight up say to give them a lot of money.. he wants others giving money the US without anything in return. Either he's asking for a donation or he's extorting the world to give money in return for nothing. 

Normal countries wood work on their debt by producing things and services and sell them, so they can fund the debt and pay it off. Trump just straight wants everybody to write him a cheque to write off that 37 trillion dollar.

The oligarchy in the US is going global at this rate. Let me give more example of how this happens. China produces a Stanley Cup at $0.70 and sells it to the middleman (Amazon) for $1. Amazon is like a parasite landlord middleman, they produce literally nothing, but they buy what the Chinese produce at $1 and sells it to Americans for $50. They make a hefty profit of $49 and the Chinese makes $0.30 per cup sold. 

Then Amazon pays little to no taxes for the $49 profit, while Americans pays for shipping, taxes, Vat, tariffs, etc. Chinese manufacturers also pay taxes to China on their $0.30 profit and take on the burden of toxic wastes, hiring people, factory operations costs.. the ones that truly make money are the oligarchy, not China or the American people. 

This is what's happening to Facebook, Uber, Amazon, Instagram, Chatgpt, etc. These are the middleman that's leeching off Americans, collecting ""rent"" and producing nothing. There was a time in China where they started arresting and killing these landlords. Jack ma saw how the oligarchy operated and wanted to stimulate the same in China, but the CCP stepped in and made him disappear for a few years, most likely to reeducate him.

The world’s wealthiest people added $304 billion to their combined net worth on Wednesday — the largest one-day gain in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — as stock markets soared after President Donald Trump pledged to pause tariffs on some trading partners.

The S&P 500 Index [jumped the most](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-09/trump-pauses-higher-duties-on-most-nations-hikes-china-tariffs) since 2008 following Trump’s mid-day announcement, reversing steep losses over the past few days and boosting the fortunes of the world’s 500 richest people by an average 3.5%. The Nasdaq Composite Index also rebounded, climbing the most in more than 24 years.

The record day comes on the heels of last week’s market meltdown following Trump’s tariff announcement. The breadth of the proposed levies exceeded most analysts’ expectations and delivered the biggest wealth losses since Bloomberg began its index in 2013.

The start of the year coincided with an unwinding of the AI trade.

Trillion-dollar tickers composing the Magnificent Seven devolved from Wall Street’s jet fuel into dead weight.

stockmarket,"No official plan has been revealed as to EU's planned retaliation to Trump's tariffs.  However, previous reporting had indicated that [EU officials were seeking European unity in formulating a response.](https://www.reuters.com/markets/eu-seeks-unity-first-strike-back-trump-tariffs-2025-04-06/)

The first concrete indications of what that response will look like were reported on by Politico, which saw internal EU documents indicating the outlines of the plan the EU has put together.  To stress, these are not final plans, let alone one which has been put to a vote or approved by the EU.  These are still draft response plans under consideration.

The plan suggests:

* The retributionary tariffs will amount to a 25% tariff on 22b Euro of US goods.  This is a more limited and smaller response than what many analysts feared a European response would look like, indicative of (for now) European leaders eager to avoid an escalatory trade war smiliar to what is currently occurring between the US and China.
* It avoids placing a tariff on Bourbon, which Trump had specifically indicated would result in a heavy retaliation were it imposed.
* While the overall scope of the tariff retribution is smaller, it is specifically tailored to target purple states in the Midwest and Red States.  For example, the Soybean tariff was the single largest good to be hit with the 25% tariff to the EU, and it would predominantly fall on midwestern states like Ohio, Michigan, Minnesotta, Iowa and Illinois.  Washing machine tariff primarily impacts Wisconsin, ice cream tariff impacts Arizona, etc.

The plan does not contemplate the ""apocalypse scenario"" of if the EU were to impose tariff duties on US services to the EU, which would dramatically escalate the scope of the trade conflict, but does not rule out such a move.  Politico notes there is significant opposition to such a move at this time, although such a drastic move may be possible with US transigience.

Trump's proposed solution was to eliminate the US-EU deficit by Europe by [agreeing to purchase $350B in US energy](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-says-eu-must-buy-350b-of-us-energy-to-get-tariff-relief/).

Antitrust investigation and billions in fines against some of the big name tech companies like Alibaba and tencent, meituan. Regulators stopped these companies from forcing merchants to choose between them.   

Ant Group IPO got halted by regulators, regulator had problems with these companies acting like banks, giving out loans/credits when they aren't banks so the whole thing for suspended 2 days before the planned IPO, Jack Ma(richest guy in China and head of the planned Ant group, basically Elon musk of China), also disappeared for like 3 months for criticizing the regulators. 

There was also the EdTech Shutdown. Basically their government felt the whole after school studying or cram school was unhealthy for kids and to reduced the inequity between those family who could afford tutors and those who couldn't since getting into a good Chinese school is hyper competitive, it makes applying for an Ivy league school look like applying for a job at McDonalds. Kids were also going to school and coming home only to attend more school online, which is kinda messed up according to their government.

Laws and regulations were passed, For-profit tutoring companies were straight up banned from interacting with primary and middle schools. New tutoring licenses were restricted. No tutoring would be allowed over weekends, holidays, and school breaks. The $100 billion tutoring industry basically collapsed over night.   

There was a data collection/ privacy law that regulated how  companies can collected, store, and use the data they collect from their consumer. Again big tech stocks took a hit. 

Lastly there was the crackdown on gaming for minors, as well as other gaming regulation like gacha style/ gambling loot box in games was made illegal. Not sure if this one got repealed or not, but it made Tencents stocks take a nose dive.

stockmarket,">China has the National People’s Congress system, where the head of state is elected by people’s representatives, yet you say China is not democratic.

A friend who used to be a low-ranking CCP member and is now a US citizen explained the basic mechanics of China’s political machine to me.  NPC is a party-controlled system, again “representatives” is not the same as “chosen representatives“, citizens have no say beyond county-level deputies and at the highest level are represented by whoever the party wants representing them.  On Election Day I receive a ballot with presidential candidates’ names on it, no Chinese citizen does, nor for NPC, Central Committee, or any other position of consequence.

Xi eliminated term limits, then was nominated by near-unanimous votes ever since - in 2023 he won by nearly 3,000 votes to precisely 0 - does that sound like a healthy democracy?  It’s not competitive voting, it’s not like there’s an alternative candidate he competes against who got the 0 votes, it’s just Xi who was nominated and NPC members (also not on any citizens ballots) can vote for or against.  The presidency is a moot point anyways, his being GS of CCP and CMC Chair are what give him his power.  Again, those positions are not chosen by real elections either, but rather more near-100% agreement by the Central Committee and NPC.

I’m not even clear why you want to call China’s system democratic or say I’m wrong saying it’s not - the system is what it is and has its strengths and weaknesses, citizens voting for their national leadership is simply not one of its features.  The US has its own unfortunate spins on this as well, such as the electoral college.  But China’s culture is far more collectivist, in my experience this doesn’t seem to bother their citizens to the extent it would Americans.

>In my view, the prerequisite for democracy is that the public has access to correct information. Without this prerequisite, all so-called democracy is fake democracy. 

I agree about democracies requiring truth to function correctly, this is why seeing hyper-polarized Western news outlets is so disturbing, they effectively act like state-run media for a single party.

>In this world, the control of media by capital and governments can distort the normal functioning of democracy from its very source. 

Yes, Xinhua, RT, or any single-party news source is bad for democracies because they give the public propaganda under the guise of journalism.  Fox and CNN today will both dry your brain and are far less healthy for the US than they were 20 years ago as both have moved further and further from center.

>For example, although most Americans have never been to China or Russia, they can believe all negative information about China, and vice versa. Most Chinese have never been to the U.S., but in China, due to media guidance, a considerable number of Chinese believe the U.S. is a paradise on earth, while many others inexplicably hate Americans.

Many Americans also have little grasp of other countries’ actual living conditions and tend to assume everywhere else is poor.  Xenophobia is influenced by many other cultural factors also, unfortunately we recently saw very clearly that there are Americans who hate not only Chinese people but Asians broadly.  The spike in violence here against Chinese- and other Asian-Americans during COVID was sickening.

>This passage perfectly illustrates how an American who knows nothing about China can easily make their own judgments.

stockmarket,"I plugged this into Deepseek to see if it's even feasible and this is what I got. Anything innacurate?

'The feasibility of Europe purchasing $350 billion worth of U.S. energy, as demanded by former President Donald Trump, faces significant economic, logistical, and political hurdles, according to recent reports:

1. **Scale of Commitment**:
   * Trump’s demand targets the EU’s $350 billion trade deficit with the U.S., proposing energy purchases as a solution. However, $350 billion is an extraordinary sum—equivalent to roughly **double the EU’s annual natural gas imports** ([politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-says-eu-must-buy-350b-of-us-energy-to-get-tariff-relief/)). For context, the EU imported $120 billion in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2023. Scaling to $350 billion would require unprecedented long-term contracts and infrastructure expansion.
2. **Infrastructure Constraints**:
   * Europe lacks sufficient LNG import terminals to handle such a volume. While terminals are being built post-Ukraine war, they are not yet operational at the scale needed. U.S. export capacity would also need to surge, requiring years of investment ([irishtimes.com](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2025/04/07/trump-says-no-pause-to-tariffs-and-urges-eu-to-buy-beautiful-us-energy/)).
3. **Political and Climate Goals**:
   * The EU aims to phase out fossil fuels by 2050. A $350 billion commitment to U.S. energy (primarily fossil-based) would clash with renewable targets and likely face resistance from member states like Germany and France.
4. **Economic Impact**:
   * Analysts, including JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, warn that Trump’s tariffs—and retaliatory EU measures—could inflate energy prices, straining economies ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/trump-tariffs-live-updates-stock-market-crypto.html)).

**Verdict**: While theoretically possible through multi-decade contracts, the proposal is politically and logistically implausible in the near term. Europe is unlikely to prioritize fossil fuel dependency over its climate agenda or accept such a lopsided trade concession without reciprocal benefits.'",plugged deepseek see even feasible got anything innacurate feasibility europe purchasing billion worth u energy demanded former president donald trump face significant economic logistical political hurdle according recent report scale commitment trump demand target eu billion trade deficit u proposing energy purchase solution however billion extraordinary sum equivalent roughly double eu annual natural gas import politico eu http www politico eu article donald trump say eu must buy b u energy get tariff relief context eu imported billion u liquefied natural gas lng scaling billion would require unprecedented long term contract infrastructure expansion infrastructure constraint europe lack sufficient lng import terminal handle volume terminal built post ukraine war yet operational scale needed u export capacity would also need surge requiring year investment irishtimes com http www irishtimes com business economy trump say pause tariff urge eu buy beautiful u energy political climate goal eu aim phase fossil fuel billion commitment u energy primarily fossil based would clash renewable target likely face resistance member state like germany france economic impact analyst including jpmorgan jamie dimon warn trump tariff retaliatory eu measure could inflate energy price straining economy cnbc com http www cnbc com trump tariff live update stock market crypto html verdict theoretically possible multi decade contract proposal politically logistically implausible near term europe unlikely prioritize fossil fuel dependency climate agenda accept lopsided trade concession without reciprocal benefit,Comment,['JPM'],Banks & Finance

stockmarket,"Hi everyone,

  
I see a lot of people saying it's the end of the world, that we're reliving 2008, or even 1929. Some are saying the S&P 500 is going to drop below 4000 points, and that we won't recover as long as the tariffs are in place.  
I have an issue with that — all the major crises in the past were primarily financial. It was the financial structure that was hit by an event that forced funds and banks to sell massively, regardless of the information flow. That was quite worrying, because no one knew when the system would start running properly again.  
Crises tied to the economy are more about market paralysis, like in the 1970s, when the stock market basically froze because of the rebound in inflation.

Today, market makers aren't being forced to sell. They've already sold, they have liquidity, and we saw that a fake news event caused a 5% spike in just 30 minutes... I don’t see any panic, any fear when I look at the charts (and I’m not talking about the VIX). What I see is a market that’s simply showing a lack of interest in equities. And every time, we get an article telling us that retail investors once again tried to buy the dip, injecting billions through ETFs. It feels like everything is under control.  
By the way, we’ll be getting the inflation numbers soon — one month after the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the two biggest trading partners of the U.S. And I’m not even convinced that played any real role in March. Quite the opposite, we actually saw a number of prices go down (like the famous eggs).

So, what do you think we’re witnessing here?

  
When I listen to chart analysts, everyone is saying it's unlikely that the resistance at 4900-4800, will be broken in the coming days, because market makers would lose too much money at those levels.",hi everyone see lot people saying end world reliving even saying p going drop point recover long tariff place issue major crisis past primarily financial financial structure hit event forced fund bank sell massively regardless information flow quite worrying one knew system would start running properly crisis tied economy market paralysis like stock market basically froze rebound inflation today market maker forced sell already sold liquidity saw fake news event caused spike minute see panic fear look chart talking vix see market simply showing lack interest equity every time get article telling u retail investor tried buy dip injecting billion etf feel like everything control way getting inflation number soon one month tariff canada mexico two biggest trading partner u even convinced played real role march quite opposite actually saw number price go like famous egg think witnessing listen chart analyst everyone saying unlikely resistance broken coming day market maker would lose much money level,Body,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
stockmarket,"Hey fellow investors, Bank of America just dropped a warning that’s got me rethinking some of my portfolio picks. They’re saying potential 2025 tariffs could hit the home furnishings industry hard, with companies like **RH (NYSE:RH)**, **Wayfair (NYSE:W)**, and **Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY)** in the crosshairs. With supply chains heavily tied to China and Southeast Asia—where tariffs could range from **30% to over 50%**—this could get messy.

**RH** is the one BofA is most worried about. They’ve downgraded it, estimating a **30% hit to operating profit**, even if RH offsets half the tariff impact and slashes 10% of SG&A costs. Vietnam, their biggest inventory source, is a tariff target, and that’s a huge red flag. They’ve got **$200–$300 million in excess inventory** to soften the blow short-term, but analysts still think RH is super vulnerable.

**Wayfair** is holding up a bit better thanks to its marketplace model and supplier flexibility. Still, they might need to hike prices by as much as **32%** to cover tariff costs, which could tank sales volumes and profits. They’ve got pricing power and a wide product range, but BofA says this round of tariffs might be tougher to dodge than back in 2018.

**Etsy** has the least direct exposure—only **25% of its products are imported**—but they’re not out of the woods. A pullback in discretionary spending could hurt, though their re-commerce platforms (Depop, Reverb) might cushion some of the demand drop. BofA calls it a “neutral-to-negative” outlook.

Here’s the kicker: the industry might not be able to pull off the 2018 tariff playbook of shifting production or eating costs. Factories are already underutilized, and suppliers are stretched thin. Without some clever mitigation, consumer prices could jump **30% or more**, which history shows would crush demand. Add in weaker sentiment and recession risks, and it’s a potential “demand-destroying cocktail,” according to BofA.

They’ve slashed their price targets too: **Wayfair** down to **$33 (from $41)** and **Etsy** to **$50 (from $55)**. Not a rosy picture.

In the good ancient times I bouhgt a stock and I got a 5-10% dividend. Once could call this sort of ""intrinsic"" value of a share.

But the enire system shifted to ""extrinsic"".

a) a company shows growing business in 8 consecutive quarters

b) margins are increasing consecutively, earnings increase in consequence

c) fundamentals show good cash flow, operatinoal margin, hard assets whatever you like.

Edit and for a while you could borrow money literally for free as the FED rate was at 0% for some years... what did people with good credit score? Lend a million and buy stocks or index certificates. The S&P otuperformed the credit interest.

And 

a times b times c equals the virtual Wallstreet stock valuation... P/E rations are irrelevant, divident vs stock price ratio is not regarded. And then someone comes up and says well we impose tariffs. That cuts into the margin. b) is in danger. Then the public opinon turns into ""we will have a trade war"". a) is in danger. In consequence c) also gets down.

This is a cubic relation... a very little change in the figures itself multiply and end up with huge ups and down.s 

And the reason why  a stock (e.g. Palantir) with an IPO at $5 can reach $120 just because it grew in the past, becaue it looks as if will grow in the future, it looks as if they increase their assets (here know how of making miliary AI), generationg revenue  in winningGouverment tenders.

stockmarket,"Most stocks are pretty heavily correlated with each other on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis. i.e. when ""stocks are up"" or ""stocks are down"", the majority of stocks will follow that general pattern.

In the long-term, individual stocks will diverge a lot though from the overall pattern. A stock can be higher or lower-volatility than the overall market, so it will move by a different \*amount\* from the overall market, even if it follows the identical direction.

Also, any time a company reports earnings there's a good chance of it making a big move up or down that has nothing to do with the broader market. This happens 4x a year. Or there could just be a big piece of news relevant to the company that doesn't affect other companies.

stockmarket,"With the VIX surging to 2008 levels amid heightened geopolitical and economic instability, the continuation of a Trump administration—one characterized by financial illiteracy and aggressive protectionism—could exacerbate market distress. The combination of extreme volatility, poorly designed trade policies, and erratic fiscal management risks triggering a deeper crisis than 2008.  

#### **Trade Wars Escalate Into Economic Contagion**  

The Trump administration’s enacted blanket **10% global tariffs** would act as an immediate tax on consumers and businesses, disrupting supply chains and fueling inflation. Unlike the targeted tariffs of 2018-2019, which were mostly absorbed by corporate margins, a sweeping levy would hit imports across sectors, raising costs for manufacturers and retailers. Retaliatory measures from trading partners (particularly China and the EU) could spiral into a full-blown trade war, stifling global growth.  

- **Stock Market Impact:** Equities, particularly multinationals and tech firms, would face severe earnings pressure. The S&P 500 could see a **20-50% correction** as trade uncertainty deters investment.  

- **Bond Market Chaos:** If tariffs reignite inflation, the Fed may be forced to **hike rates** into a weakening economy, crushing credit markets. Corporate defaults could spike, mirroring the 2008 credit crunch.  

#### **Fiscal Recklessness and Debt Crisis Fears**  

The previous Trump administration added nearly **$8 trillion to the national debt** via tax cuts and stimulus. A second term—especially one lacking economic expertise—could see even more **unfunded tax cuts and spending**, worsening the U.S. fiscal trajectory.  

- **Bond Vigilantes Return:** If markets lose confidence in U.S. debt sustainability, Treasury yields could **surge uncontrollably**, triggering a **liquidity crisis** in mortgage and corporate debt markets.  
- **Dollar Instability:** A loss of faith in U.S. policymaking could weaken the dollar, further aggravating inflation and capital flight.  

#### **Central Bank Trapped Between Inflation and Collapse**  

The Fed would face an impossible choice:  

- **If it cuts rates** to ease financial stress, inflation could resurge, destroying confidence in the dollar.  
- **If it hikes or holds rates**, debt servicing costs explode, risking a **2008-style credit seizure**.  

#### **Worst-Case Scenario: A 2008-Style Crash With No Policy Guardrails**  

Unlike 2008, when Bernanke’s Fed and a technocratic Treasury (Paulson, Geithner) stabilized markets, a financially illiterate administration might: 
 
- **Misdiagnose the crisis** (blaming “short sellers” or the Fed rather than structural risks).  
- **Pursue erratic interventions** (market manipulation attempts, politicized bailouts).  
- **Fail to coordinate globally**, worsening contagion.  

### **A More Dangerous Crisis Than 2008?**  

The 2008 crash was contained by expert crisis management. This time, a combination of **trade wars, fiscal recklessness, and policy incompetence** could turn a market correction into a **systemic meltdown**. Investors should brace for:  

- **A steeper, longer bear market** than 2008-2009.  
- **Currency and sovereign debt instability**.  
- **Potential capital controls or market freezes** if panic escalates.

I'm looking for feedback on content and format. 3 of the bullets will be recap of the previous week, upcoming economic reports, and important earnings reports. The other 2 will be dependent on current events.

If you're interested in joining the newsletter, DM me with your email. Thanks!

\----

1. **Market Recap and Tariff Impact**

Last week, a new tariff announcement led to a notable decline in the stock market, with the S&P 500 dropping by nearly 9% since the announcement and over the weekend. This was particularly tough on technology and manufacturing sectors, which rely heavily on imported parts. Investors are now watching closely to see how these companies will adapt, possibly by raising prices or changing supply chains.

**2. Upcoming Economic Indicators**

This week, keep an eye on two key economic reports: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Thursday, April 10th, expected to rise by 0.3% from last month, and Producer Price Index (PPI) for March and consumer sentiment (preliminary) for April on Friday, April 11th, which will show how consumers and producers are feeling. These numbers can sway market moods, especially in areas sensitive to interest rates and consumer demand, so they’re worth watching for potential market shifts.

**3. Earnings Season Highlights**

Several big names are set to share their first-quarter earnings this week. Delta Airlines reports on Wednesday, April 9th, with updates on how travel has been impacted by the tariffs. CarMax follows on Thursday, April 10th, with a focus on used car sales. JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo wraps up on Friday, April 11th, with details on the banking sector. These reports can offer a window into how these industries are faring.

4. **Sector Outlook and Investment Strategies**

The tariff news suggests tech and manufacturing might struggle with higher costs, while domestic makers could see advantages. To handle possible market ups and downs, consider spreading investments across different sectors and setting clear trading plans. Staying informed and focusing on long-term goals can help navigate this week’s uncertainties.

**5. Stay Safe out There**

Given the potential for increased market volatility this week due to tariff uncertainty, economic data releases and earnings reports, investors should adopt prudent strategies to navigate uncertainties. Staying informed is crucial, with investors encouraged to keep up-to-date with all relevant news and data releases that could affect their investments.

stockmarket,"I know the post is a little on the alongside, but bear with me. It is about a 120-second read.

The recent volatility and bearish trajectory in U.S. equity markets have prompted renewed speculation about the potential for an impending recession. While headline indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have experienced sustained downward pressure, the broader macroeconomic context offers a more nuanced landscape. To evaluate recessionary risk, it's critical to analyze the interplay between equity markets, labor market resilience, inflation trends, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance.

# Equity Market Decline: A Leading Indicator or Lagging Signal?

Historically, substantial and prolonged declines in the stock market have often preceded economic downturns, serving as a leading indicator of reduced business investment, waning consumer confidence, and tightening financial conditions. However, the causality is not always direct. Market corrections can occur due to exogenous shocks or valuation resets without necessarily spilling over into the real economy.

In the current environment, the equity selloff may reflect several intertwined factors:

* **Valuation compression** in the face of elevated risk-free rates,
* Concerns over **earnings deceleration**,
* Geopolitical instability and its impact on global risk appetite, and
* Heightened **liquidity premiums** as quantitative tightening persists.

The key question remains: **Is market stress sufficient to catalyze or signal a broader contraction in aggregate demand?**

# Labor Market Fundamentals: A Buffer Against Downturn

Despite market jitters, the U.S. labor market remains notably robust. Unemployment rates hover near historic lows, labor force participation is stable, and wage growth—though moderating—continues to outpace pre-pandemic trends. Initial jobless claims have not spiked materially, and the job openings-to-unemployment ratio remains elevated, suggesting demand for labor persists.

However, there are early indications of **labor market normalization**:

* Declining quit rates (a proxy for worker confidence),
* Flattening payroll growth and
* A rise in involuntary part-time employment.

These may represent the onset of **cyclical softening**, but absent a sharp contraction in hiring or a spike in layoffs, the labor market remains a pillar of economic resilience.

# Inflation Moderation and the Fed’s Deliberate Posture

Headline inflation has moderated from its 2022 peaks, driven in part by base effects, improved supply chains, and monetary tightening. Yet **core inflation**, especially in services and shelter, remains stubbornly high. The Federal Reserve, prioritizing price stability, has signaled a “higher for longer” stance, indicating rate cuts will be data-dependent rather than preemptive.

This raises key concerns:

* **Real interest rates** remain positive, which constrains credit-sensitive sectors.
* The lack of policy easing amidst slowing growth could amplify downside risks via **procyclical tightening**.
* A delayed monetary response could erode consumer and business sentiment if disinflation proves transitory.

# Questions for the Road Ahead

Given these intersecting dynamics, the central question is whether the current macro-financial configuration constitutes a sufficient condition for recession. Key questions include:

1. **To what extent will declining equity valuations transmit to the real economy through wealth effects or impaired capital markets?**
2. **Can the labor market maintain its momentum if corporate profits come under sustained pressure?**
3. **Is the Fed’s cautious stance inadvertently contributing to a policy lag that could exacerbate a downturn?**
4. **Will inflationary stickiness in core categories delay the onset of rate cuts and tighten financial conditions further?**
5. **Are forward-looking indicators—such as yield curve inversion, credit spreads, and PMI readings—signaling a synchronized economic slowdown?**",know post little alongside bear second read recent volatility bearish trajectory u equity market prompted renewed speculation potential impending recession headline index p nasdaq composite experienced sustained downward pressure broader macroeconomic context offer nuanced landscape evaluate recessionary risk critical analyze interplay equity market labor market resilience inflation trend federal reserve monetary policy stance equity market decline leading indicator lagging signal historically substantial prolonged decline stock market often preceded economic downturn serving leading indicator reduced business investment waning consumer confidence tightening financial condition however causality always direct market correction occur due exogenous shock valuation reset without necessarily spilling real economy current environment equity selloff may reflect several intertwined factor valuation compression face elevated risk free rate concern earnings deceleration geopolitical instability impact global risk appetite heightened liquidity premium quantitative tightening persists key question remains market stress sufficient catalyze signal broader contraction aggregate demand labor market fundamental buffer downturn despite market jitter u labor market remains notably robust unemployment rate hover near historic low labor force participation stable wage growth though moderating continues outpace pre pandemic trend initial jobless claim spiked materially job opening unemployment ratio remains elevated suggesting demand labor persists however early indication labor market normalization declining quit rate proxy worker confidence flattening payroll growth rise involuntary part time employment may represent onset cyclical softening absent sharp contraction hiring spike layoff labor market remains pillar economic resilience inflation moderation fed deliberate posture headline inflation moderated peak driven part base effect improved supply chain monetary tightening yet core inflation especially service shelter remains stubbornly high federal reserve prioritizing price stability signaled higher longer stance indicating rate cut data dependent rather preemptive raise key concern real interest rate remain positive constrains credit sensitive sector lack policy easing amidst slowing growth could amplify downside risk via procyclical tightening delayed monetary response could erode consumer business sentiment disinflation prof transitory question road ahead given intersecting dynamic central question whether current macro financial configuration constitutes sufficient condition recession key question include extent declining equity valuation transmit real economy wealth effect impaired capital market labor market maintain momentum corporate profit come sustained pressure fed cautious stance inadvertently contributing policy lag could exacerbate downturn inflationary stickiness core category delay onset rate cut tighten financial condition forward looking indicator yield curve inversion credit spread pmi reading signaling synchronized economic slowdown,Body,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

We may have more tariff announcements on China from Trump, but watch Trump's social media accounts for any marginally positive headlines based on if he has calls with leaders from other countries. 

[**BRK (Berkshire Hathaway)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BRK&p=d)\- Overall less vol than SPY for (close to) equivalent performance.

[**SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) / [**DIA (SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIA&p=d) / [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)\- The long market ETF trade, of all the bounce plays this is the least risky and doesn't concentrate your money in a single play.

[**F (Ford)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d) / [**STLA (Stellantis)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=STLA&p=d) / [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d) / [**CAT (Caterpillar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CAT&p=d)\- Overall screwed mainly due to the massive tariff exposure they have, not too interested in investing in any of these hoping for a change on tariffs.

[**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)\- Also facing a major downturn mainly due to the selloff in BTC, Cathie Woods bought in but that's not too meaningful. Interested in the $137.50 level.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\- Mainly looking at this due to AAPL being the most exposed of the MAG7 due to iPhones, interested in what it does after if it breaks $180.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Dan Ives (a historically bullish analyst) has slashed his price target to $315 (from $550), calling it a ""political symbol"" and says that the ""brand crisis tornado has turned into a F5 tornado"". Overall still consider this uninvestible.

[**SVIX (Short VIX 1X ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SVIX&p=d) / **(short** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**)**\- The short VIX trade- SVIX isn't meant to be held for longer than one day (it's an inverse VIX futures ETF), VXX is a better choice if you choose to short vol (but still not meant to be held for more than a few weeks). This is not for beginners, please understand what ""backwardation"", ""inverse futures ETF"", and what happened in XIV in 2018 before you trade this.

stockmarket,"
For 100 years or so we have lived in a world in which the USA is the strongest economy in the world and sets the tone. I am new to world of investments and stocks, my father is teaching me the basics and as of right now making most of the transactions in my portfolio. He has in my opinion a blind faith in the us economy and it's strength. but in light of the recent actions taken by Trump and their devastating affects on the markets I am forced to rethink. I know that the US economy is arguably stronger than all of the EU combined and most of Asia. With all that said there is still a question that I can't stop thinking about:

how likely is all that to change? Because if Trump will continue in his current course of trade wars things won't get better!

what to do right now? Keep investing in the US market or go to Europe.

For some context I am 22 years old, have a modest portfolio meant for long term investments which as of now consisting of: IVV, GRNY, S&P 500 Equal Weight, S&P 500 Financials Sector and NASDAQ.

stockmarket,"I seriously don’t understand how anyone on Wall Street is acting shocked right now. We — the supposed “rational actors,” the champions of capitalism — are supposed to know the ABC of economics. Literally any first-year undergrad in econ could tell you: tariffs are bad. They’re inefficient, regressive, and always end up hurting consumers and global alliances. And yet, here we are — again.

Now you’ve got Ben Shapiro and other conservative voices suddenly sounding the alarm, acting like they just realized tariffs are economic poison. Are you kidding? Trump ran on this explicitly. He implemented them in 2018. There was no ambiguity. He’s not pretending to be Milton Friedman.

And don’t even get me started on the Wall Street royalty that lined up behind him:
Steve Schwarzman (Blackstone)

Bill Ackman, the guy who says he’s a disciple of Buffett

Jamie Dimon, who played the centrist game but stood by him when it counted

Stanley Druckenmiller, always talking macro while backing chaos

Even Scott Bessent, who was literally the CIO of Soros Fund Management — yes, Soros! — and still publicly backed Trump yesterday

If they couldn’t see the consequences of enabling a tariff-happy populist, then either they’re dishonest or delusional. This is not just a political miscalculation — it’s an economic betrayal. These people should’ve known better. Most of them do know better. And now they want to act surprised when markets react violently?

stockmarket,"Reciprocal tariffs, as implemented in 2025, are negatively affecting the stock market through several interconnected mechanisms, based on the economic dynamics and market reactions observed around this period.

First, these tariffs—designed to mirror the trade barriers imposed by other countries on U.S. goods—have significantly increased the cost of imported goods for U.S. companies. This directly impacts corporate profitability, especially for firms reliant on global supply chains. Higher input costs, such as those for raw materials or components, squeeze profit margins unless companies can fully pass these costs onto consumers. However, with consumer confidence already shaken by tariff-related uncertainty, demand may weaken, making it harder for companies to raise prices without losing market share. For example, industries like automotive and technology, which depend heavily on imported parts, face immediate pressure, as seen with companies like Apple and Nike experiencing sharp stock declines due to their exposure to international trade.

Second, the tariffs have sparked retaliatory measures from major trading partners like China, the European Union, and others. This escalation into a broader trade war disrupts export markets for U.S. firms, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Reduced export demand translates into lower revenues, further eroding earnings forecasts. Analysts from institutions like Goldman Sachs have estimated that every five-percentage-point increase in U.S. tariff rates could cut S&P 500 earnings per share by 1-2%, a significant hit given the scale of the announced tariffs, some as high as 54% on countries like China.

Third, the uncertainty surrounding the scope, duration, and potential negotiation of these tariffs has fueled market volatility. Investors hate unpredictability, and the lack of clarity—whether these tariffs are a negotiating tactic or a permanent policy—has led to a risk-off sentiment. This is evident in the sharp sell-offs following tariff announcements, with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 5% in a single day in early April 2025, marking its worst performance since June 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has been hit even harder, sliding into bear market territory as investors flee growth stocks with high exposure to global trade, like the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which derive over 50% of their profits internationally.

Finally, broader economic concerns amplify these effects. The tariffs are projected to raise U.S. consumer prices, with estimates suggesting an additional $1,000-$2,000 per household annually, stoking inflation fears. This could force the Federal Reserve to pause rate cuts or even hike rates, tightening financial conditions and pressuring stock valuations further. J.P. Morgan Research, for instance, revised its 2025 GDP growth forecast down to 1.3% and raised inflation projections, signaling a stagflation-like scenario that spooks equity markets. The resulting drop in consumer and business confidence also curbs spending and investment, creating a feedback loop of economic slowdown that drags down stock indices.

In summary, reciprocal tariffs are hammering the stock market by **raising costs and cutting profits**, triggering retaliatory trade barriers, injecting uncertainty, and threatening broader economic stability. The result is a volatile, downward trajectory for equities as investors grapple with a rapidly shifting trade landscape. Many companies are literally ""jumping at shadows"", because of fear of lost revenue. 

Some of these countries hammer us with their tariffs way worse than what we charge them. The play is to get THEM to stand down and reduce tariffs on the US. If there are no changes in the next 120 days, congress and others will take measures against the tariffs.",reciprocal tariff implemented negatively affecting stock market several interconnected mechanism based economic dynamic market reaction observed around period first tariff designed mirror trade barrier imposed country u good significantly increased cost imported good u company directly impact corporate profitability especially firm reliant global supply chain higher input cost raw material component squeeze profit margin unless company fully pas cost onto consumer however consumer confidence already shaken tariff related uncertainty demand may weaken making harder company raise price without losing market share example industry like automotive technology depend heavily imported part face immediate pressure seen company like apple nike experiencing sharp stock decline due exposure international trade second tariff sparked retaliatory measure major trading partner like china european union others escalation broader trade war disrupts export market u firm particularly sector like agriculture manufacturing reduced export demand translates lower revenue eroding earnings forecast analyst institution like goldman sachs estimated every five percentage point increase u tariff rate could cut p earnings per share significant hit given scale announced tariff high country like china third uncertainty surrounding scope duration potential negotiation tariff fueled market volatility investor hate unpredictability lack clarity whether tariff negotiating tactic permanent policy led risk sentiment evident sharp sell offs following tariff announcement p dropping nearly single day early april marking worst performance since june tech heavy nasdaq hit even harder sliding bear market territory investor flee growth stock high exposure global trade like magnificent seven derive profit internationally finally broader economic concern amplify effect tariff projected raise u consumer price estimate suggesting additional per household annually stoking inflation fear could force federal reserve pause rate cut even hike rate tightening financial condition pressuring stock valuation j p morgan research instance revised gdp growth forecast raised inflation projection signaling stagflation like scenario spook equity market resulting drop consumer business confidence also curb spending investment creating feedback loop economic slowdown drag stock index summary reciprocal tariff hammering stock market raising cost cutting profit triggering retaliatory trade barrier injecting uncertainty threatening broader economic stability result volatile downward trajectory equity investor grapple rapidly shifting trade landscape many company literally jumping shadow fear lost revenue country hammer u tariff way worse charge play get stand reduce tariff u change next day congress others take measure tariff,Comment,"['GS', 'SPGI']",Banks & Finance

stockmarket,"Perhaps I am oversimplifying things here, but bear with me for a second.

This graph is a rough schematic representing the US stock market or the S&P 500 or whatever broad market index you like.

The valuations of stocks was steadily climbing until it reached a point in mid-February 2025 when things were at an all time high (point A on the graph). Then there was a steep drop since then which we are currently experiencing right now due to tariff related turmoil in the markets.

Eventually, we will reach the bottom. Nobody knows when this will be, but there will eventually be a bottom that has either already occurred or will occur in the future (represented as point B).

The value of X in the chart represents the total percent drop that the market will experience. It could be 15-20% or it could be 50-60%, or somewhere in between.

After the drop, we will have a recovery or a period of sideways trading and then a recovery.

I am not trying to time the bottom because you don’t know you’re at the bottom when you are experiencing it. For all we know, this past Friday was the bottom.

What I am trying to do, is to figure out how much of a recovery after the most recent bottom I would want to see in order for me to decide, okay, let’s return to investing in good companies for the long term.

To give an example, let’s say that between now and June 2025, the S&P 500 drops by a total of 30% from its all time high in February. If you saw a 6% percent recovery in the S&P by August, would that make you feel like that’s enough to know that the worst is behind us and that you can confidently put your money in the market again? This would represent a 20% recovery of the value lost in all this.

The idea here is not that we try to time the market and invest exactly at the bottom, but instead that while we can’t identify when we are at the bottom, we can certainly look back and say that the bottom has passed us already and that we can still capture some large percentage of the recovery in stock prices before the market makes a new all time high (whether that be months or years from now into the future).

Lastly, I know people are going to say this to me, but **please do not recommend that I DCA throughout this market downturn or that I invest a set amount on a regular basis.** I know that this is a wise and effective investment strategy, but it is simply not the point of this though exercise.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

As of today, the U.S. stock market has lost about $9.6 trillion in value, largely due to new tariffs. Around $5 trillion of that drop happened in just two days, Thursday and Friday.

Dow Jones: down 10%

S&P 500: down 13.7%

Nasdaq: down 19.5% (officially in bear market territory)

>These tariffs have sparked fears of a trade war and recession. The IMF has warned of serious risks to the global economy, and China’s retaliation has only made things worse. Despite all this, Trump insists the economy is strong.

The entire GDP is about 27 trillion. We are flirting with losses at almost HALF the entire value of US economy. Almost 1/5 of the entire US GDP in just 48hours. This is insane, and we haven't seen the response yet from the countries that the tariffs were imposed on yet. I fear this will get a lot worse before it gets better.

As of today, the U.S. stock market has lost about $9.6 trillion in value, largely due to new tariffs. Around $5 trillion of that drop happened in just two days, Thursday and Friday.

Dow Jones: down 10%

S&P 500: down 13.7%

Nasdaq: down 19.5% (officially in bear market territory)

>These tariffs have sparked fears of a trade war and recession. The IMF has warned of serious risks to the global economy, and China’s retaliation has only made things worse. Despite all this, Trump insists the economy is strong.

To put that into perspective. The ENITRE GDP of US is about 27 trillion. We are flirting with losses of almost HALF the GDP of the entire US market. And still dropping

Net exporting companies, who have net US dollars from the trade cycle, have been putting increasing amounts in the US stock market over the last 15 years - more so than bonds which is where they traditionally would put their excess US dollars.

Since then there have been net decreases every month.   Now with tariffs likely hampering trade, meaning less net dollars to those countries, the drain out of US equity markets will be even greater likely.

That capital will flow into south Pacific and European and developing markets.  And it is not just for show and stock prices.  As those equity markets expand, innovated new businesses/startups will start flowing to those markets for the increasing capital which means America will not be the top business innovating nation any more.

valueinvesting,"Passive investing + the 'American exceptionalism' trade + low risk free rates.

Passive investing will continue. We saw it during yesterday's relief rally, in which Apple, the company most affected by the US-China trade war, rallied along with the rest of the Mag 7. It's a double edged sword though, just as stocks in indices like the S&P 500 disproportionately benefit from funds inflows to the market, they'll disproportionately get sold off as wealthy boomers sell off to fund late life elder care expenses, or investors in other nations repatriate their funds.

The later is a real headwind. American markets have outperformed those in other developed nations for decades, and part of this is the 'American exceptionalism' trade. America for decades was considered stable in politics and policy, and unlike other developed countries, offered growth. We're presently seeing this unwind, as in the foreign media of the US's historically closest allies, the US is no longer viewed a reliable ally or trading partner. The withdrawal of much the 16 trillion foreign investors hold in US equities would alone lead to flat or declining markets over 47's administration. 

And the last issue of recent low risk free rates is most important. Over longer periods, equity markets usually trade at a equity risk premium to 'risk free' assets, with the S&P 500 earnings yield (inverse of P/E) trading mostly at a 300 to 500 bp over the 10 year Treasury yield since 2003. Deviations above the range are useful buy signals, deviation below sell signals. 

Think about what that implies. For 30 years, from 1968 to 1997, the US 10-year treasury traded at yields from 6% to as high as 15%. At 7% with a 300 bp equity risk premium, the S&P 500 should gravitate towards a 10 PE. Historically recent 10-year yields have been much lower, since 2008, the 10yT yield has mostly been between 1.5 and 4%. At 1.5% + the same premium, the S&P 500 should gravitate to a 22 PE. And at the present 4.26% 10 Y yield, perhaps PEs around 14 are appropriate.",passive investing american exceptionalism trade low risk free rate passive investing continue saw yesterday relief rally apple company affected u china trade war rallied along rest mag double edged sword though stock index like p disproportionately benefit fund inflow market disproportionately get sold wealthy boomer sell fund late life elder care expense investor nation repatriate fund later real headwind american market outperformed developed nation decade part american exceptionalism trade america decade considered stable politics policy unlike developed country offered growth presently seeing unwind foreign medium u historically closest ally u longer viewed reliable ally trading partner withdrawal much trillion foreign investor hold u equity would alone lead flat declining market administration last issue recent low risk free rate important longer period equity market usually trade equity risk premium risk free asset p earnings yield inverse p e trading mostly bp year treasury yield since deviation range useful buy signal deviation sell signal think implies year u year treasury traded yield high bp equity risk premium p gravitate towards pe historically recent year yield much lower since yt yield mostly premium p gravitate pe present yield perhaps pe around appropriate,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
valueinvesting,"One thing to note is the make up of the companies in the US as well. Some of the largest companies in the S&P500 are insanely profitable (on a cash basis) and should be valued higher vs the major companies of previous decades (explicitly not commenting on over/undervalued here). 

The majority companies of the past only had a 10-15% unlevered free cash flow margin and had real meaningful variable costs in generating each incremental dollar of revenue, so less incremental cash flow. 10-15% is a guess - don't have figures handy and not running an analysis for this. They also generally grew slower just given more capital intensity, less access to global markets, etc. Some of the major companies of today have much higher unlevered free cash flow margins with a stronger ability to grow year over year, it makes sense to pay up relative to the earnings of the major companies of yester-year.

To put it simply, VISA/META/etc incremental cash flow from an incremental sale is damn near 100% (probably). Exxon's/Coca Cola's/Whatever Steel Co/Rail Transport Co/etc marginal cash flow is not as high.

Your comments on more dollars chasing the investments definitely is valid though and has accentuated the valuation issue. But I think the make up of the market has much stronger, more profitable companies then previous years. They should be valued higher given they are better businesses and that has led to a general elevation in market metrics. Again, stating I'm commenting on over/under valued - but they should be valued higher relative to more legacy style, less profitable businesses.

valueinvesting,"Yesterday made me think twice about all the doom-and-gloom posts lately. A fake tweet about temporarily pausing tariffs sent the S&P 500 surging by as much as 8.5% within 34 minutes, briefly adding trillions in market value. 

This wasn’t just a blip; it shows that investors are ready to jump back in at the first hint of good news. 

The S&P 500 swung from a 4.7% loss to a 3.4% gain before plummeting again after the White House denied the report.

This reaction tells us that despite all the chatter about a long-lasting crash, the market is primed for a quick recovery. As soon as there’s a real sign of stability (like a resolution on tariffs) investors will likely pour back in fast.

valueinvesting,"Grok says.-As of the end of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's cash and short-term investments, primarily in U.S. Treasury bills, totaled $334.2 billion. To determine the percentage of its investments in cash, we need to consider this amount relative to its total investment portfolio. According to the latest available data, Berkshire Hathaway's total assets were approximately $1.1 trillion at the end of 2024. The cash and short-term investments of $334.2 billion represent about 30% of these total assets.

However, if we narrow it down specifically to Berkshire's investment portfolio (excluding other assets like operating businesses), the marketable equities were valued at $272 billion at year-end 2024, down from $354 billion the previous year, as noted by Warren Buffett in his annual shareholder letter. When considering only these marketable equities plus the cash, the total ""investment"" pool would be $272 billion (equities) + $334.2 billion (cash) = $606.2 billion. In this context, the cash portion of $334.2 billion equates to approximately 55% of Berkshire Hathaway's investments in marketable equities and cash combined.

This high cash allocation reflects Buffett's strategy of maintaining liquidity, especially as he reduced stakes in major holdings like Apple and Bank of America during 2024. Note that this percentage could shift depending on how one defines ""investments""—whether it includes only marketable securities or also the value of wholly owned subsidiaries—but the 55% figure aligns with the focus on cash and public stock holdings as of the latest reports.",grok say end berkshire hathaway cash short term investment primarily u treasury bill totaled billion determine percentage investment cash need consider amount relative total investment portfolio according latest available data berkshire hathaway total asset approximately trillion end cash short term investment billion represent total asset however narrow specifically berkshire investment portfolio excluding asset like operating business marketable equity valued billion year end billion previous year noted warren buffett annual shareholder letter considering marketable equity plus cash total investment pool would billion equity billion cash billion context cash portion billion equates approximately berkshire hathaway investment marketable equity cash combined high cash allocation reflects buffett strategy maintaining liquidity especially reduced stake major holding like apple bank america note percentage could shift depending one defines investment whether includes marketable security also value wholly owned subsidiary figure aligns focus cash public stock holding latest report,Comment,['BAC'],Banks & Finance

He used the example of Chinese stocks; that they did not trade at the same multiples as US companies because their government can do whatever they want whenever they want regardless of fairness.

valueinvesting,"I don't feel the need to panic either, but I've always thought that anyone invested solely in large cap US companies is not sufficiently diversified, which I think the current moment is revealing. Saying ""the S&P 500 gets 35% of its revenue internationally"" doesn't negate the need for international diversification, because you're still exposed to political risk.

Markets will persevere, yes. The US economy will continue to do well, most likely. But I also think it's likely that the premium American stocks have enjoyed in the last 15 years relative to international stocks is coming to an end. The reason you pay 3x as much for a dollar of American earnings as you do for a dollar of Korean or Polish or Brazilian earnings is because you believe the American political system is more stable, the American rule of law is stronger, the American dollar will remain stronger because of that stability, and American corporate growth will remain superior due to a favorable business environment, enviable R&D spending and its status as an attractive place to immigrate to for education and business. All of those advantages are being chipped away at. Does the US market still deserve a premium? Maybe. Does it deserve such a massive one? I don't see how you can make that case given the damage that's been done just in the first few months of this administration.

The premium will erode, and US stocks will likely underperform in the decade ahead even if the US economy continues to do well. I don't think that's panicking; that's just determining probabilities based on the information we have.

valueinvesting,"# 0. The context

Back in early March, I wrote a quick piece that I posted here and on Blind, spotlighting two undervalued stocks that weren’t getting the attention they deserved (Fresh Del monte Produce and Upwork). While the feedback overall was positive, a comment really stuck with me (Figure 1). It got me thinking — are we entering an era where strong, stable, cash-generating businesses are being overlooked simply because they don’t scream “tech” or “AI”?

*Figure 1. Teamblind.com user’s comment on FDP (Link at the end)*

The market's obsession with innovation has left traditional “boring” companies — those in capital-intensive, interest-dependent sectors — largely ignored. But here’s the thing: these businesses often act as the ballast in a portfolio, especially during downturns. They may not 2x in a quarter, but they do offer something invaluable: resilience. And in today’s environment of fear and macro uncertainty, that matters more than ever.

In this piece, I’ll highlight two such “boring day” stocks — that are navigating the current turmoil with surprising grace. Think: stable fundamentals, smart capital allocation, and a business model that thrives even when the macro gets messy. These aren’t the stocks you'll hear hyped on social media, but they might just be what your portfolio needs to stay grounded.

# 1. Progressive Corp — PGR

**Description:** The Progressive Corporation operates as an insurance company in the United States. The company writes insurance for personal autos and special lines products, including motorcycles, RVs, and watercraft; and personal residential property insurance for homeowners and renters.

*Figure 2. PGR stock rating card by Charly AI (Link at the end)*

**Investment thesis:** Year to date PGR is 7% up vs S&P 500 which is 14% down. PGR has demonstrated strong financial performance with significant improvements in profit margins (from 6.2% to 11%) and earnings per share (EPS increased from $6.61 to $14.45). The combined ratio, a key profitability measure in the insurance industry, improved to 88.8%, indicating better cost management. The company's strategic investments in technology and product innovation, such as usage-based insurance programs, position it well for future growth. Despite some concerns about operating cash flow being lower than net income, the overall financial health is robust, with stable cash balances and minimal share dilution. The stock is currently undervalued based on a DCF analysis, with an intrinsic value suggesting a margin of safety. Given the strong short-term and long-term growth prospects, along with a bullish technical trend, a BUY recommendation is appropriate. The potential risks, such as competitive pressures and regulatory challenges, are mitigated by Progressive's strong market position and strategic initiatives.

**2. Verizon Communications — VZ**

**Description:** Verizon provides communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide.

*Figure 3. VZ stock rating card by Charly AI (Link at the end)*

**Investment thesis:** Year to date *VZ* is 8% up vs S&P 500 which is 14% down. Verizon’s stock outlook is cautiously optimistic, balancing its strategic growth initiatives with lingering financial risks. The company is making strides in expanding its 5G network, IoT partnerships, and fiber infrastructure, which should drive long-term growth. These efforts are already showing results, with the Consumer segment growing (1.3% revenue increase) and net income rising sharply to $17.95 billion in 2024, supported by cost reductions and tax efficiencies (effective tax rate down to 21.9%). Additionally, Verizon’s high dividend yield (6.13%) and undervaluation (P/E of 11.13) make it appealing for income-focused investors. However, challenges remain, including a declining Business segment (-2.0% revenue) and a high debt load ($144 billion), though debt is decreasing and cash flow remains strong (operating cash flow of $36.9 billion).

The stock’s technical indicators suggest positive momentum, with bullish MACD signals and a recent price uptrend. While the Business segment’s struggles and past goodwill impairments ($5.8 billion in 2023) warrant caution, Verizon’s focus on high-growth areas like IoT and cybersecurity partnerships positions it to offset these weaknesses. For investors with a moderate risk tolerance, the combination of reliable dividends, strategic investments, and improving financial health (free cash flow up to $19.8 billion) supports a BUY recommendation. The stock’s current valuation and growth potential outweigh near-term risks, making it a compelling choice for both income and growth-oriented portfolios.

valueinvesting,"I know the Shiller PE is Buffet's favorite valuation metric along with alot of value investors. I have a few questions. The Shiller PE sitting April 7th 2025 sits around 31 with an historical average of 17; implying a roughly 80% overvaluation. However, the S&P Index PE currents sits around 22x implying a roughly 29% overvaluation. So here's the question The Shiller PE taking a trailing 10 year average can be skewed by bad years like 2020 with massive earnings misses, as well at the Tech bubble in 2018, dragging down the denominator of the Shiller PE giving the illusion of a much bigger overvaluation. Additionally, It does not take into consideration the AI boom having caused massive efficiencies and profit margin expansion, that the Shiller PE assumes should over time come back down, not taking into consideration these efficiencies are not part of an eb and flow of the economy, but a technological breakthrough that permanently changed how businesses operate.  Meanwhile the S&P index 22x valuation all be it still overvalued, can experience multiple compression much faster due to the nominator of this ratio being inflated to high by few companies in the high double digits and some triple digit multiples. if someone of the Palentir's of the index deflating, could bring us back into only somewhat overvalued; NOT resulting in a potential lost decade you would assume would be coming if you followed the Shiller PE. 

  
So my opinion being, which valuation metric should we trust? according to the Index PE, we could be back to fair value with around another 10%ish correction in addition to the one we just experienced. Not to mention profit margin expansion from the AI boom could merit a higher average multiple for the index  then the historic average

  
But according to the Shiller PE we should have another 80% drop to go.

valueinvesting,"I rode LNC from $25 upwards to $40 and sold off at $37.50 before the market started tanking.  Last week I grabbed some $30 leaps in case it bounces back in the next six to twelve months. 

To preface I went from owning something like 20-30 financial companies to nothing in December to January expecting the market to tank for geopolitics plus a consumer slowdown so it was just an all around bearish sentiment for me in the market and not in particular to LNC. They have products such as index linked annuities where their performance will be tied to the broad market so you'll get wild swings like we have seen recently. 

Because of COVID life insurance produced significant earnings tailwinds and the segment is essentially valued as a zero, however as time passes and underwriting continues they'll burn through the book and normalize profitability. 

It's been around for 120 years and trading at a decent discount to book especially after the recent drop now but it's not something you want to hold if the broad market is dropping. 

Quote from Miller Value Partners: 

""Achieving long-term free cash flow conversion targets would support annual free cash flow in excess of $1B. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple close to four times, every one multiple point improvement generates approximately 25% in share price returns (significantly higher than the S&P 500 today which would be closer to 5% for each multiple point improvement and for the top five market caps, closer to 3%)."" This quotes a bit over a year old but it stands true still. 

Their assets have potential to build significant ROE so I'm just waiting for a couple catalysts to jump back in, you can make an excellent return if you know roughly when to enter and exit. I'm generally bullish long-term on their products going forward from a demographic perspective. A very important aspect of investing in insurance is understanding and testing the quality of the company's book and examining any counterparty risks, and overall LNC is not very solid during downturns. 

Edit: if you're bullish broad market buy it and hold for 6-9 months and you'll make more than holding S&P, especially if we get rate cuts. Personally I'm not bullish yet and could write an entire book as to why lol.

valueinvesting,"*Upfront — I post frequently on this subreddit and get accused sometimes of using ChatGPT (\~sigh\~) since the writing is very polished, but the writing is 100% from me. (I'm a full-time podcaster and financial writer, and the research I usually share here is adapted from my free newsletters, and I post here to get feedback on my findings/ideas. Also, note that this was written for an audience that may not be familiar with Reddit.) With that, enjoy:*

It’s a special thing to redefine what it means to be part of a “community.” Yet, that’s exactly what Reddit, known colloquially as “the Front Page of the Internet,” has done.

With billions of posts capturing 20+ years of human interaction and conversation, Reddit is an unrivaled corpus of human experience, which is very valuable — just ask the AI companies paying tens of millions of dollars for licensing rights to Reddit’s data, such as Alphabet and OpenAI, to help their models understand how to communicate like a human.

Reddit’s business is at an inflection point, rapidly growing its advertising business, building its own AI chatbots, and quickly growing internationally, all of which have combined to help Reddit reach profitability for the first time last year while leaving plenty of room for optimism about how this emerging social media giant can grow going forward.

The future is promising, but is the stock too richly priced? Let’s find out.

**Reddit: The Front Page of the Internet**

In a world of AI, Reddit is authenticity. Given the platform’s pseudonymous nature, users are actually empowered to be more real than they otherwise would be when bound by their own identities.

Not sure what I mean? To see this effect in action, go into [r/jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/), the jobs subreddit, ask for career advice, and contrast that with the advice you get on LinkedIn, where everyone is strictly bound by their corporate identities.

While unfiltered and sometimes crass, people on Reddit will not hesitate to tell you how it really is. Candid feedback is the default.

On LinkedIn? Well, come on. LinkedIn is a laughably sanitized environment by Internet standards; everyone is presenting a corporate image of themselves: polished, intelligent, and without controversy, but also 100% synthetically inhuman.

Not to just beat LinkedIn into the ground here, but you get the idea. Reddit is the exact opposite, so much so that 40% of the internet deems Reddit recommendations as their most trusted factor in purchasing decisions.

Reddit’s biggest strength from a user perspective belies its biggest weakness as a business: Social media platforms primarily monetize themselves through ads, but how does one build an ad business around a company that aims to know as little as possible about its users?

Reddit doesn’t demand your real name, zip code, occupation, or any other similar data that Facebook has famously abused to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in value.

In other words, Reddit knows comparatively less about you, which is why it’s so popular (people are free to “be themselves”), but this is also why Reddit has been a bad business for a long time.

This explains why I (Shawn), after having used Reddit for nearly a decade, chose to sell out immediately after participating in its IPO at the sweetheart price of $34/share. I locked in a 50% gain and felt pretty smart, capitalizing on the company’s effort to offer IPO shares to long-time users and moderators until the stock quickly ran up to become a 6-bagger in the following months.

I missed out big time, but in hindsight, it was the “right” decision from a first-principles perspective. I certainly gave up some upside (okay, a lot of upside), but I also hadn’t seriously studied the company’s underlying business and, rightfully, noticed that the company had failed to successfully make itself profitable after two decades. Not a good sign; Facebook, for context, took five years to reach profitability.

I was purely trading Reddit, which I knew to be a form of “gambling,” and thus took a very small stake and treated it purely as fun (and that’s okay to do from time to time as long as we know we’re gambling!) Now, I’m revisiting Reddit with sober eyes.

I can’t recall ever seeing an ad before 2023 on the platform (not to say there weren’t any, but they were and far between and probably of low quality), and I was pretty sure that sales of so-called Reddit Coins — the virtual currency used to purchase awards that can be given to others for insightful posts — weren’t that lucrative of a business.

Reddit was a bad business, or at least a grossly under-monetized one, but that isn’t the case anymore.

**The Times, They Are a-Changin’**

A lot can change in a year. Since I made that regrettable decision, Reddit has found the light. In Q3 2024, the company became profitable for the first time and extended that delightful trend once again in the fourth quarter.

To Reddit’s credit, the business is churning on all fronts, with advertising dollars growing 71% year-over-year while daily active users grew almost 40%.

Even more promising, though, is that the company is fast discovering how powerful economies of scale can be for an accelerating internet business, as operating margins have improved from -24% in 2022 to -13% in 2023, 2% in Q3 2024, and then to 12% in Q4 2024. What a swing!

A 36 percentage point improvement in operating profit in two years is no small feat, highlighting how overhead, marketing, R&D, and other costs don’t scale proportionally with sales for companies with massive online platforms like Reddit. That dramatic inflection toward profitability shows no signs of stopping, either — I expect 2025 to be even more promising.

The bigger question we’ll get to in the valuation section is determining the degree of operating profitability Reddit can achieve once it matures.

Reddit has considerably improved its earnings power, increasing its inventory by unlocking new types of ad placements (like sponsored comments, since comment sections are lively places on Reddit, and “Ask Me Anything” sessions) while improving its interface for advertisers by providing more tracking tools and enabling more sophisticated sponsorship campaigns.

What Reddit lacks in individual user-level data, it makes up for with passionate communities. No, you can’t precisely geolocate an ad campaign to target people in an exact area, like the city your small business operates in, but you can make up for that by placing your ads in front of a highly engaged audience primed to interact with your advertisement at that moment.

Facebook thrives at delivering ads to very specific types of individuals, yet that doesn’t guarantee they’re in the right headspace to see an ad. Yes, your bakery’s ads targeting me because I live in a certain town might be reaching the ideal target customer in theory, but if I just had lunch before seeing your ad, it’s not exactly going to drive me to make an impulse purchase of croissants for pickup.

But with Reddit, you can deliver ads directly to users of [r/baking](https://www.reddit.com/r/baking/), a community of 3.7 million bakers so passionate about their craft that they’ve sought out a community of like-minded individuals for recommendations, recipes, and feedback.

This works especially well for nationwide brands that are less location-sensitive about who they market to but care a whole bunch about finding people passionate about a given niche.

Imagine a Reddit post in [r/baking](https://www.reddit.com/r/baking/) chock-full of comments debating the best type of blender to use and then inserting an ad for your blender right in the middle of it.

This is clearly very powerful and extends to Reddit’s thousands of subreddits, each one specifically catering to a certain type of niche, from supplements to fitness, investing, fantasy books, Call of Duty video games, hiking, travel, parenting, and everything in between — incredibly fertile terrain for advertisers of all stripes.

**Free Labor(!)**

Beyond improvements in ads, including attracting more advertisers and higher quality advertisers, Reddit’s business benefits structurally from the army of moderators who manage its communities entirely for free, setting posting rules, deleting spam, and banning parasitic users.

This, again, is what makes Reddit special. Reddit is a decentralized place. Unlike TikTok, Instagram, X, and Facebook, there’s no central feed based on who you follow, at least not quite in the same way. Your feed is instead curated by the communities (subreddits) you interact with, making Reddit distinctly less influencer-driven and also very democratic.

Posts only rise to the top as they’re upvoted by users in the subreddit they're posted to, not because a user has a large following and gets a boost from the algorithm at the start. It’s thus more meritocratic than other social media sites.

And, as I mentioned, moderators proudly volunteer time to manage their favorite subreddits, helping organize and foster civil conversation while weeding out the stuff that makes other platforms so distasteful at times.

Being a moderator for a popular subreddit is a rite of passage for some, a position of power worth far more than any currency. Seriously, moderators are often what you might nicely call “chronically online,” and the clout that comes with moderation is of considerable significance to them.

From the company behind Reddit’s perspective, this is a wonderful advantage. They have a devoted, almost cult-like base of users who manage the platform’s vibrant communities without compensation. That, in theory, should allow Reddit to be structurally more profitable than many of its peers, as it needs to invest considerably less in technology and employees for content moderation and oversight.

**The Elephant In The Room: Google**

Reddit has long been a digital town square and the internet’s pulse, as measured in upvotes and downvotes. Reddit has over a hundred million daily active users on average and, in terms of brand recognition and search volume, ranks up there alongside companies like Netflix — Reddit is the sixth most searched term on Google.

Now, that’s partially a testament to its popularity, especially with the younger generation, but it also reveals that Reddit has long had a poor interface and worse search functionality. Ironically, it is often easier to add “Reddit” to the end of a Google search query to find the information you want on Reddit than it is to use Reddit’s own search bar.

This has created a symbiotic relationship with Google, where Google has come to recommend Reddit more for searches since nearly every topic has been discussed in depth there and because the feedback on Reddit is so highly valued, and Reddit has come to rely heavily on Google for much of its traffic, as much as half of it.

Traffic from Google is great until even just brief changes to the search engine’s algorithm cause massive swings in visitors to Reddit, breeding uncertainty over how stable Reddit’s user base actually is. Reddit’s goal is to convert these digital tourists, using Google to find specific answers on Reddit, into scrollers who download the app and treat it as a form of entertainment.

Awkwardly, Reddit is looking to monetize its corpus of user data not just by licensing its data to AI companies, as mentioned earlier, but also by building its own LLM trained specifically on Reddit posts known as Reddit Answers.

I say this is awkward because you’d presume that, if Reddit is competing with Alphabet in the world of AI chatbots and search, then Google would eventually be less inclined to recommend Reddit going forward, cutting off an important source of traffic for Reddit.

Now, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman has said he views Alphabet as a close partner and has no fear about this dynamic working against them, but I remain less convinced. Nevertheless, I will be closely watching Reddit’s ability to convert visitors who frequent its site without creating an account into bonafide users who are more monetizable and stable (visiting Reddit by app, intentionally, rather than through Google.)

**Reddit-nomics**

Reddit’s most valuable asset is its community (a community of communities, you might say.) Each new user adds incremental value not just by consuming content but by generating it — fueling a cycle of engagement that drives more users to the platform, expanding it into increasingly niche areas and attracting users focused on those niches.

The beauty of this growth model is that it is largely self-reinforcing, as there’s a home for anyone on Reddit, though branching out beyond the U.S. has been easier said than done.

Reddit is highly dependent on the U.S., with more than 40% of its users there, but it’s keen to change that. Reddit’s next chapter will be focused on expanding the platform internationally so that its user base better reflects the word’s population distribution (i.e., U.S. users at 4% of total users, not 40%.)

This demands a light touch. Communities must arise organically, reflecting real people’s passions, so how do you get more people to join Reddit in different countries and create culturally relevant subreddits in those areas?

Paid marketing will increase awareness but not necessarily foster new communities, so Reddit doesn’t do much of it. Instead, they reach out to people they think are uniquely qualified to launch subreddits outside the U.S. and provide resources on how to best moderate new communities.

More interesting than bootstrapping communities in various countries is the company’s initiative to translate content into any language, removing barriers and making any post and subreddit accessible to anyone worldwide, regardless of the language it’s posted in.

This is great for scaling adoption and making Reddit’s body of valuable recommendations, first-hand experiences, and other shared information more accessible. Consider, for example, that some of the best recipes for Chinese food in the world might be in a Chinese subreddit, making those delicious insights unavailable to the non-Chinese speakers of Reddit (which is most of Reddit.)

Using machine learning and AI, Reddit can increasingly make that, well, no longer an issue, freeing some of the best family recipes for Chow Mein the world has ever seen from the confines of language.

To capture the nuances of the jargon and vernacular used across Reddit, accurate translation across language is no small effort, but Reddit is slowly scaling this feature and expects to offer translation between half a dozen or so languages by the end of 2025.

Again, this makes more subreddits available to more types of people, which is great for user growth, engagement, and also advertising.

**Valuation & Portfolio Decision**

There’s a lot to like about Reddit. It has proven it can grow internationally with ample room to continue doing so. Reddit’s total user base is a small fraction of Facebook’s (3 billion monthly users), Instagram’s (2 billion monthly users), and about a third of X’s estimated daily users, despite having the potential for universal appeal — I truly believe there’s a subreddit for everybody!

And the flywheel around its advertising is beginning to spin faster and faster as the company pours millions of dollars into refining its advertising technologies for sponsors tapping into Reddit’s rich ecosystem of discussion and recommendations.

This reveals why advertising revenues can grow 31 percentage points faster than new users (71% YoY vs. 40%) — Reddit has had plenty of low-hanging fruit to pick in making their platform more advertiser-friendly.

As a result, Reddit should be able to increasingly close its ARPU gap (average revenue per user) with Meta, which earns roughly 3x as much per user as Reddit.

Part of this will be more inventory, better targeting, and simply awareness amongst corporate sponsors who increasingly see Reddit as a legitimate advertising destination, as well as Reddit’s international growth, making the platform more attractive to global brands.

Reddit’s international ARPU is growing at 13%+ per year compared with 6% per year for U.S. users (from 2022-2024), underscoring a double tailwind: International adoption of Reddit is growing faster than in the U.S., and international users are becoming more valuable, too.

In other words, the amount of money Reddit earns per user outside the U.S. is growing at twice the rate of U.S. users, reflecting A) how Reddit had under-monetized international users for years and B) is now meaningfully changing that.

At the same time Reddit is beginning to flex its muscles, the business continues to benefit from the economies of scale I mentioned earlier.

Operating margins have dramatically improved, and 2025 will likely be the company’s first full year of profitability. With operating margins at 12% in Q4 2024, the question I keep asking myself is what margins can look like five years from now?

To illustrate Reddit’s economies of scale in action, consider the following: Reddit spent $142 million in Q2 2024 on R&D, representing 51% of revenue. By Q4, they were investing $187 million in R&D — an increase of more than 30%(!) — yet, because revenue grew even faster from $281 million to $428 million, R&D costs as a percentage of revenue fell to 44%.

That’s a seven percentage point improvement in operating profit margins while the company continued to dramatically reinvest in its technical capabilities.

That’s a wonderful thing: If your business is growing fast enough, you can aggressively reinvest in yourself, deepening competitive moats while still boosting profit margins. Advantages compound, as R&D spending makes advertising more effective and adds features to the platform that enhance the user experience, enabling the company to spend even more on R&D while margins grow — the Big Tech names of the last decade know this formula quite well.

With user growth compounding at 20% a year in the last few years and ARPU growing, too, I think Reddit can plausibly double its user base by 2029, providing enough scale for operating margins to rise north of 30%.

For reference, Meta’s operating margins are above 40%, and while Meta has more user data and a larger scale of users, Reddit benefits from the unpaid army of moderators who sustain its platform, structurally supporting Reddit’s profitability (by reducing overhead costs as fewer employees are needed.)

Using a range of exit multiples of operating profit (aka EV/EBIT), from 24x operating profit to 46x, reflecting a variety of plausible market environments and sentiments surrounding the company depending on its outlook in 2029, I derive a weighted-average share price target of between $100 and $110 per share with a 25% margin of safety. This target implies a 12%+ return over the next five years if we can snap up shares in this range.

It’s not an exact science, but if we look at Airbnb, another powerful but slightly more mature platform/network effect company, it trades at a nearly 30x multiple of operating profits, while Spotify trades at 59x.

As a result, I feel that my range of exit multiples — the valuation I think the stock could trade at by the end of a 5-year holding period, is reasonable given how fast Reddit has grown and will probably still be able to grow in a few years.

This also doesn’t account for higher-than-expected operating margins thanks to scale or revenues from its tangential business units, like data licensing, something that doesn’t only appeal to AI companies but also financial firms: Intercontinental Exchange recently signed a deal for access to real-time Reddit data to gauge market sentiment and spawn related financial products, no doubt inspired by the power of the Wall Street Bets movement and its ability to move markets, as was most clear with GameStop’s meteoric 2021 rise.

**Final Thoughts**

I’ll be the first to say that, for a company like Reddit, with so much growth at its fingertips while inflecting to profitability, there’s a wider-than-usual range of possible outcomes when looking out 5 years.

Maybe operating margins never exceed 20%, or user growth hits a wall due to changes in Google’s search algorithm, or perhaps international ARPU remains stagnant and doesn’t narrow in on U.S. ARPU, or maybe the surprises are to the upside, with operating margins exceeding 40% and user growth considerably more than doubling — there’s a wide range of realistic outcomes for Reddit, meaning that there’s a wide range of intrinsic value calculations one could come up with for this company.

If you look at Reddit and get a valuation half mine, or twice as much, that doesn’t surprise me, which is why Reddit will be such a fun company to continue following and initiate a small position in. I’m incredibly optimistic about how they can grow internationally and continue earning more money per user, but not everyone agrees with me — Feel free to download and play around with my model for Reddit [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FKA2gXPivzX9T53B5N1Acu9_mPXPY4aQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103928094368337364430&rtpof=true&sd=true) to add in your own assumptions.

valueinvesting,"The past couple of days have been brutal — red across the board, fear creeping in, and plenty of knee-jerk reactions. But instead of reacting emotionally, I revisited my investment philosophy, and it reminded me why staying the course is the only path forward for long-term investors. Regardless of the outcome, strong businesses are most likely to survive and potentially come out stronger when the dust settles.

In all honesty, while the drop has been steep and very quick, we are all still sitting on pretty good returns be it 2yrs, 3 yrs, 5 yrs or longer like 10 years. I wouldnt be surprised if the markets fell another 20% or so, and yet we will only go back to where we were a couple of years ago. Will it happen? I got no clue like everyone else. 

In any case, here’s a quick summary of my investment philosophy:

What I buy: Wide-moat businesses in attractive industries. Think companies with limited substitutes, high switching costs, and real pricing power.

When I buy: Only at fair value or a discount to intrinsic value.
	
What I pay: Usually when P/FCF is < 20 and in line with historical valuation.

How much I allocate: No single idea gets more than 25% of the portfolio.

When I sell: Only when the business no longer meets the criteria above.

Sticking to your philosophy matters especially now. Few companies I think still look compelling after this recent pullback: AMZN, MSFT, TMO, ICE, OXY, railways and Pipelines — all solid, long-term moaty businesses.

valueinvesting,"I work in the oil and gas industry. I bought oil stocks and started to DCA heavily into oil stocks during covid crash because that is the industry I am in and know. I knew from the numbers that covid was a nothing event and that the recovery would be quick rapid as the world still needs oil. I did very well on those stocks and moved to a more balanced approach in March 2024.

Sure, the stock market was ripping through 2024, which is why it is important to keep investing throughout as the market can stay irrational for a very long time, but there were signs of huge underlying problems where people can build a cash pile.

If you needed signs that the world was teetering on the edge of a knifes blade.  Let's just pick a couple of easy headlines.

-German manufacturing through 2024 declined 4.5% ( historically the third to fourth largest economy )

-UN and world bank projected global growth of 2.6% which is below historical average.  ( 2.6% growth is right at the threshold for global recession. )

-China #2 economy in the world economic slowdown.  China's GDP historically has been 8-10%  2024 was between 4.5-5%

-Global economic growth slowed in 2024 to around 3.2% below pre pandemic levels of 5.4-5.9%  Average!

-OPEC cutting 2.2 million barrels per day to keep oil prices higher due to reduced demand from China.

The S&P forward P/E  was approximately 25-40% overvalued, depending on the time frames before this recent pullback.  These are exactly the times to take off 15-30% and hold cash at a 4% guaranteed return.

What happens next? When will I buy back in with my cash position?  The market HATES uncertainty, and the path Trump has set has put the odds of recession by mid 2025 to 60% by JP Morgan.

There has to be some resolution to the recent tariff announcement.   Example: Trump walks back his global tariffs to 5-10% blanket.  I think the world could live with this.  98% of the countries haven't responded yet, and look what happened when China said they will counter tariff. -6%  who's next?

“Highest conviction stock picks for the coming 10 years”

———

1.	⁠I would seek out companies with the highest competitive advantage (aka “economic moat”)
2.	⁠Long operating history, great financials low debt. Pays a dividend preferably.
3.	⁠Wait for the price to reach the wtb price.

MCCCGRWS

M for Moody’s. Only one other main competitor S&P 500 ( the other Fitch is a fluffer). Their rating business is boring but stable but will tumble during a recession. The other business, data analytics, is growing faster but has more competition. This is one of Buffett’s never sell stock.

C for Costco. Growth is slowing. Overseas expansion is the way to go. Investors love this company to bits. So buy only during dips. In terms of growth I am only modeling for 9% CAGR eps, while market is expecting 12% and higher. 

C for Copart. Salvage car auction. The only other guy in the market lost the GEICO account to Copart. They own land for salvage cars which is a moat, since these are not so common. More [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/5r7bvdeMY4).

C for Cintas. Cintas makes money from their laundry service for uniforms(plus others). Their competitive moat is that they have high route density (scale) and therefore service many national accounts. This industry was started by the founders of this company during the depression. Very simple business but very hard to displace.

G for GE. GE sells engines but makes money from servicing those engines. There are roughly 40,000 engines in use today. Boeing and airbus have a long backlog of offers to fulfill meaning the demand is very high for GE engines.Tariffs is a large unknown. Many had hoped that China would not impose reciprocal tariffs to include GE engines but I thinks this is still evolving .

R for Rollins. Rollins is a pest management company. This industry is fragmented by local and regional players, only a handful can service accounts nationally, Rollins is one such company. Route density (how many customers can it service in a typical day)  ensures that their largest input costs (fuel and labour) are  optimised. Their other large competitor is still trying to integrate from their merger (rentokill/terminix)

W for Waste Management. This company owns land fills (which is harder to own these days), and has scale and capabilities to handle pickup, processing, recycling and extraction of biofuels. They recently expanded to medical waste management from the purchase of stericycle. This business is somewhat recession resistent.  (Note, bill Gates is invested in the smaller competitor RSG )

Lastly S for maybe Stryker. This is a medical device maker that has expanded beyond the hip and knee replacement business, making it more diversified and less lumpy results wise compared to its competitors Zimmer biomet . Note that this is a bet on a greying population and rising middle income worldwide.

valueinvesting,"The S&P 500 is down 14% year-to-date — no surprise given the wave of tariff fears and a market clearly in correction mode. In this kind of environment, finding a stock that’s not just holding its ground but actually growing feels nearly impossible. And yet, here comes Harmony Gold Mining (HMY), quietly defying the trend — up 60% YTD (see Figure 1). HMY’s performance is driven by two key factors: the tailwinds from the sector the company operates in, and its solid operational performance.

*Figure 1. HMY stock performance year to date* 

**1. HMY - Sector Tailwind**

HMY operates in the mining sector, engaging in the exploration, extraction, and processing of mineral properties in South Africa, Papua New Guinea, and Australasia. The company primarily explores for gold, as well as other minerals such as uranium, silver, and copper. We all know that gold is historically viewed as a ""safe-haven"" asset. During periods of stock market volatility, economic uncertainty, or geopolitical tension — like now — investors typically shift capital to gold to preserve wealth. This leads to higher gold prices, benefiting mining companies like HMY. However, the full 60% growth in HMY isn’t solely explained by gold’s 16% increase year-to-date (according to Trading Economics).

**2. HMY - Solid Operational Performance**

*Figure 2. Charly AI HMY stock card*

HMY has delivered impressive results, with revenue jumping 19% and net profit surging 33% over the last six months, fueled by higher gold prices and smarter operations. The company generated record free cash flow (R10,392 million), allowing it to reward shareholders with its highest-ever interim dividend. While gold production dipped slightly, Harmony’s strategic focus on high-grade projects like Mponeng and its upcoming copper production signals a shift to diversify revenue and reduce risk. Harmony’s balance sheet is rock-solid, boasting a net cash position of R7,283 million—giving it flexibility to invest in growth without relying on debt. Risks like gold price swings and operational hiccups remain, but Harmony’s disciplined cost management and strong cash generation provide a cushion against volatility.

Technically, the stock has seen wild swings (52-week range: $7.97 to $15.22), but recent indicators like the MACD hint at upward momentum. While the RSI suggests the stock isn’t oversold, the recent pullback could be a chance to buy into a company trading at reasonable valuations (P/E in line with peers) with clear growth catalysts. The push into copper adds a long-term tailwind, complementing gold’s role as a safe-haven asset. With gold prices staying elevated and Harmony’s operational improvements gaining traction, the stock looks poised for growth.

**3. How do you build your portfolio**

Beyond the BUY, HOLD, or SELL question, HMY’s performance raises a key question for investors: “How do you build your portfolio?” For me, a balanced portfolio blends growth and defense: equities (\~50%, e.g., dividend stocks), bonds (\~30%, income stability), gold (\~10%, crisis insurance), and cash (\~10%, liquidity). Warren Buffett, though critical of gold’s non-productivity, acknowledges its psychological allure: “People… feel gold has some magic stability.”

P/E ratio was at 30 with S&P at 6000. High P/E, but with decent growth ahead, so not OK, but not terrible either. So an ""/E"" of 200.

P/E of 30 without growth, means you have 3.33% on your money. All while bonds yield are 4.5%

Take away the growth, let the companies eat up some of their proffit and let it drop, i don't know 10%. So that ""E"" becomes 180. 

The deinvesting in the US, could lead to falling dollar, along with tarrifs, cousing high inflation. Lets call it a 10%. The real hidden inflation is already pretty high, in the end the FED could be raising intrest rates up to 10% just to match it and bring it down again.

That means P/E ratio's will be matching that too. P/E of 10 or lower. Let's add the risk premium and call it a P/E of 8. 

8 x that 180 from above = 1440. 

Of course this can play out in several years, 5?, and companies raise their prices while doing so, and there will be minimal growth so add maybe 7%/Y back in it. 

1440 x 1.07^5 ≈ 2000. An S&P of 2000.... in 2029

But you can see that real shit can hit the market. Without the underlying companies and their profits even taking a big hit. It shows you even more on how ridiculously expensive the S&P was, and how sensitive the markets can react on profit stagnantion and intrest rates.

valueinvesting,"In my opinion:

It is the uncertainty that is roiling the markets.  As well as the rate of market losses. (> 10% Evaporation in roughly 2 days)

As well as almost everyone lowering their earnings expectations-forward guidance. Even if tariffs are temporary, corporate margins will be squeezed in 2Q-3Q. This affects their earnings. So being beholden to the shareholders, companies have to reduce expenses. Cutting labor/jobs/payroll/benefits. Downward spiral ensues. Saw a stat recently that said 2025 gains (consumer spending) was on the backs of upper class/wealthy and they have started to pare back spending (See AMX). 

So, lets us 250-260 as 2025 earnings/sh, (tad on lower end of consensus-before liberation day, so is fair imo). In slowing economy w elevated/sticky inflation, (fear abounding), what multiple are you willing to pay? Lets say ave in last 20 yrs=19.

valueinvesting,"Hi all,

To begin, my thesis is: 

\- The S&P500 is not above decades-long stagnation as we've seen in Japan and elsewhere. Backdated performance ignores that the US enjoyed uncontested superpower status for decades. This is no longer the case

\- The majority of growth in the US came from an overheated tech sector which was long-due devaluation. Until recently the US effectively had a monopoly on tech, but Tik Tok, BYD, Deepseek show that's no longer the case, and regulatory pushback against big tech from even the EU show signs of global pushback

\- There are no other growth industries in the US that can sustain the level of economic growth that we've seen. Certainly not manufacturing as the current admin is purportedly keen to revive

\- Singapore, India, China, Indonesia, any many others are growing economies with much higher ceilings but have less accessible markets for retail investors.

valueinvesting,"If it endures, Donald Trump’s decision on April 2 2025 to enact sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on US trade partners will go down as one of the greatest acts of self-harm in American economic history. They will wreak untold damage on households, businesses and financial markets across the world, upending a global economic order that America benefited from and helped to create. The president spoke brazenly from the Rose Garden at the White House on Wednesday, delivering a protectionist agenda well beyond most analysts’ worst-case scenarios. Within a week, the US will be enclosed by a minimum 10 per cent tariff wall on all imports, reinforced by hefty individualised duties on nations with sizeable US trade deficits. These build on levies already announced by the administration, including on China, Mexico, Canada and the auto industry. The combined effect will lift America’s effective tariff rate to its highest in over a century. Trump’s justification hinges on a naive belief that treats trade imbalances as if they were the profit and loss account of a business, and not the culmination of highly specialised supply chains. He also considers factory work to be the fount of economic development, ignoring how decades of free trade has enabled America to rise up the industrial value chain and become a global leader in services and innovation. His “reciprocal” levies amount to a back-of-the-envelope calculation. They take trade partners’ US trade deficit in goods as a share of imports from that country, and then divide it by two. This is not a calibrated attempt to equalise tariff and non-tariff barriers facing US exporters, perceived or otherwise. It is, however, a reckless repudiation of all trade agreements the US has signed, as well as a deeply flawed plan to attract foreign manufacturing investment. For the US economy, the most immediate effects of Trump’s actions will be to raise inflation and slow economic activity. Capital Economics reckons Trump’s tariff blitz could push US annual inflation above 4 per cent by the end of the year, heaping further pain on households that have suffered from a 20 per cent rise in prices since the pandemic. Interest rates may now stay higher for longer. American businesses should be shell-shocked. They face the costly and complex task of finding domestic suppliers. The prospect of sectoral tariffs and retaliatory measures, alongside the administration’s slapdash approach to policymaking, will hinder investment plans and any chance of sparking a manufacturing renaissance. Financial markets are volatile too. The S&P 500 and the US dollar plunged in early trading on Thursday. Confidence in US economic exceptionalism continues to evaporate. As for those most reliant on selling goods into the US, the economic downsides of Trump’s tariffs will be substantial. Decades of progress in poverty reduction across south-east Asia, in particular, is now at risk. Sluggish growth in major economies, including the EU, Japan and China, will be compounded. The temptation to retaliate will be strong. But this moment calls for cooler heads. Trump has promised to fight fire with fire. Policymakers must carefully weigh their next moves. Instead, America’s now shut-out trade partners ought to focus on expediting free trade initiatives among themselves. After all, the US accounts for just 13 per cent of global goods imports, and with the exception of those in the White House, the economic imperative of comparative advantage continues to be widely understood. This was no “liberation day” for America. If Trump gets his way, the US economy will be isolated from the very system that has powered its century-long rise. The whole world will suffer, but it need not follow America’s path.",endures donald trump decision april enact sweeping reciprocal tariff u trade partner go one greatest act self harm american economic history wreak untold damage household business financial market across world upending global economic order america benefited helped create president spoke brazenly rose garden white house wednesday delivering protectionist agenda well beyond analyst worst case scenario within week u enclosed minimum per cent tariff wall import reinforced hefty individualised duty nation sizeable u trade deficit build levy already announced administration including china mexico canada auto industry combined effect lift america effective tariff rate highest century trump justification hinge naive belief treat trade imbalance profit loss account business culmination highly specialised supply chain also considers factory work fount economic development ignoring decade free trade enabled america rise industrial value chain become global leader service innovation reciprocal levy amount back envelope calculation take trade partner u trade deficit good share import country divide two calibrated attempt equalise tariff non tariff barrier facing u exporter perceived otherwise however reckless repudiation trade agreement u signed well deeply flawed plan attract foreign manufacturing investment u economy immediate effect trump action raise inflation slow economic activity capital economics reckons trump tariff blitz could push u annual inflation per cent end year heaping pain household suffered per cent rise price since pandemic interest rate may stay higher longer american business shell shocked face costly complex task finding domestic supplier prospect sectoral tariff retaliatory measure alongside administration slapdash approach policymaking hinder investment plan chance sparking manufacturing renaissance financial market volatile p u dollar plunged early trading thursday confidence u economic exceptionalism continues evaporate reliant selling good u economic downside trump tariff substantial decade progress poverty reduction across south east asia particular risk sluggish growth major economy including eu japan china compounded temptation retaliate strong moment call cooler head trump promised fight fire fire policymakers must carefully weigh next move instead america shut trade partner ought focus expediting free trade initiative among u account per cent global good import exception white house economic imperative comparative advantage continues widely understood liberation day america trump get way u economy isolated system powered century long rise whole world suffer need follow america path,Body,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

That said, I think the tariffs are unlikely to change his long-term view of any company's fair value unless import costs make up a significant chunk of their total costs.   
  
Some businesses will get hit hard by this. Walmart, as an example, imports 1/3 of their products while most of it is sourced domestically. 

Of course, those domestic items could be made with imported materials, so let's just say 50% is affected. 

That's a 27% total increase in cost of goods sold. (54% tariff on China \* 50% of goods.) 

They only have a profit margin of 3%, so after factoring in other costs, they'll be losing money unless they manage to pass on the entirety of their tariff bill to customers. 

But Berkshire's holdings are not likely to be directly hit by the tariffs. BAC and insurance companies don't have much tariff to deal with. Coke is actually going to be hit by the tariffs simply because of the aluminum they use in their cans. (They might switch back to glass or plastic.) 

BUT do tariffs change the competitive edge of his businesses? Not unless their competitors are uniquely exempted from them.

**I want to show you which companies are on my radar at the moment and which investment themes (or “buckets”) I have been digging into recently.** Here I posted a part of my watchlist, related to the topics I wanted to discuss today, if you are interested: [https://maksimrodin.substack.com/p/tariffs-uncertainty-which-stocks](https://maksimrodin.substack.com/p/tariffs-uncertainty-which-stocks) 

Two of these companies have already hit my price targets, and I will be buying and posting deep dives in the following days. Make sure to subscribe to receive these updates.

Let’s dive right into my investment “buckets”:

# Small investor “edge” (or “special situations bucket”)

Many great value investors (Buffett included) started with under-the-radar micro/small caps, which are not investable for large institutional investors, and made their initial fortunes there.

This “special situation” can be anything from restructuring (management change/change in capital allocation strategy, spin-off, post-bankruptcy) to catalyst-driven (liquidation, M&A, divestments) to special balance sheet situations (net-net, hidden asset, negative EV, etc).

The problem is that you’ll find a truly great “special situation” maybe a few times a year. **If you don’t like extreme concentration (like me), you can’t follow only this approach.** So, I expect the “special situation bucket” to be 30-50% of the portfolio.

# Monetary debasement / inflation

Inflation is already here, and I believe that in the next decade, we will see more of it[1](https://maksimrodin.substack.com/p/tariffs-uncertainty-which-stocks#footnote-1-160518679).

Now, how to protect yourself against it?

**Exposure to Hard Assets**

Hard assets are known to be natural inflation beneficiaries. The more scarce and the more important for the economy the particular physical asset is, the better it is protected, since people can’t stop consuming it. Examples are:

* **Land & water**
* **Natural resources**
   * Energy: oil, gas, coal, uranium
   * Industrial metals: iron, copper
   * Precious metals
   * Rare earth elements
   * Food and fertilizers
   * Aggregates: cement, sand
   * Timber
* **Infrastructure**
* **Real estate**

**The Disadvantaged Business Model**

It’s good when your revenues are exposed to hard assets - they will grow with inflation. But if you have high operating expenses or high capital requirements, they will do the same, thus offsetting the benefit.

That’s why miners, for example, are bad compounders. When the resource they mine is cheap, they hardly have enough cash flows to survive and sometimes even need to raise debt to stay in the game.

When the resource is expensive, they have enough cash coming in, but they have to reinvest everything to repay the debt, refresh their equipment, and build/acquire new mines. And they have to do all this at the top of the cycle, when everything is expensive.

Real estate or infrastructure companies are also not great, even though they have a more stable cash stream in comparison to miners. They require a high initial investment and employ a lot of leverage. It makes them very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Plus, to grow, they again need to invest a lot and raise more debt.

**The Better Business Model - Owning a “Tollbooth”**

The better way to get exposure to hard assets is through owning a “tollbooth”.

**The royalty and streaming** business is the ideal example. Gold streaming companies, like FNV or WPM, or oil and gas royalties, like [PSK.TO](http://PSK.TO) or VNOM are just collecting their “tolls” on the volume of the produced resource.

These companies benefit from low operating expenses and minimal capital requirements, enabling them to maintain little or no debt, achieve higher operating leverage, and invest counter-cyclically. This results in higher profit margins, strong free cash flow conversion, and ultimately, **superior long-term compounding of capital.**

Another approach is to get **exposure to unique real assets** through companies that have established strong market positions by making **substantial upfront investments and achieving economies of scale**, ideally operating within industries **protected by stringent government regulations**.

In such cases, once fixed costs are covered, a business can scale efficiently through increased volume/price. For example:

* Cheniere Energy is the largest operator of LNG terminals in the U.S., and building new terminals from scratch is nearly impossible due to strict regulatory barriers and significant capital requirements (“tollbooth” on LNG flows).
* ADM dominates grain and seed processing. Many of the things you have on the table pass through ADM's processing infrastructure, making the company virtually irreplaceable at this point (“tollbooth” on food flows).

**Exposure to Financial Flows**

The cheaper the money, the more of it circulates within the system. So it’s appealing to invest in businesses that naturally benefit from this expanding nominal pie:

* **Payment processors** (e.g., Visa or Mastercard) are probably the best example. These companies profit directly from rising transaction volumes. The more you pay for products every day, the more they earn. And it’s without any risk to their own capital, all while being almost irreplaceable in the current financial system.
* **Financial Exchanges** (e.g., ICE or CME) are similar to payment processors. The more volume and volatility there is in financial markets, the more they earn without risking their capital. They all have very entrenched positions and are additionally protected by substantial regulatory barriers.
* **Brokers** (e.g., Interactive Brokers) across various industries—financial, insurance, or commercial real estate—also benefit from higher transaction activity, capitalizing on increased economic circulation with limited exposure to capital risk.
* **Market makers** (e.g., Flow Traders) also benefit from higher volume and volatility on financial exchanges. The only downside in relation to all the above-mentioned models is that market makers risk their own proprietary capital.

# Future themes “bucket”

Besides the broader inflationary theme, there are several other, narrower themes that I follow. It’s a double-win if I find a company that satisfies the previously mentioned criteria while also being exposed to one of these themes. In no particular order:

* **Energy density** (continued use of high-density sources of power, like oil, gas, nuclear power, hydro power, and geothermal power)[2](https://maksimrodin.substack.com/p/tariffs-uncertainty-which-stocks#footnote-2-160518679)
* **The green transition is slower** than expected (e.g., Hybrids vs EVs, Coal is still needed, especially Met Coal, etc)[3](https://maksimrodin.substack.com/p/tariffs-uncertainty-which-stocks#footnote-3-160518679)
* **US and global gas prices convergence** (US gas prices are much cheaper than global, and it should change with more pipelines and LNG terminals being built, and a potential usage of natural gas as a power source for data centers)[4](https://maksimrodin.substack.com/p/tariffs-uncertainty-which-stocks#footnote-4-160518679)
* **Data centers / AI**
* **Passive investing**
* **Crypto**

# Moats “bucket”

And the last “bucket” is for moats. Obviously, I try to own companies that have strong moats:

* **Economies of scale**
* **Network effect**
* **Intellectual property**
* **Monopoly / Duopoly**
* **Strong Consumer Brand**
   * *""A brand is a wonderful thing to own during inflation""- Warren Buffett*

# Conclusion

**I try to invest in companies that have an overlap of several investment “buckets”.** Unlike special situations, the main problem with “quality” companies is that their quality is often well-understood by the market, and the market rewards them with premium valuations.

As a value investor, it’s hard for me to buy something that is too expensive. However, periods of market volatility—like the one we're currently experiencing—create windows of opportunity.

**Hopefully, we will be able to grab some great companies at fair (or even cheap) prices in the next weeks/months.**",last month especially since yesterday market digesting uncertainty stemming tariff

valueinvesting,"So, I've been saying to my friends and family since around entire second half of 2024 (but tbh even earlier like 2 years ago), like a broken record, that the market is overpriced and it's very weird in its behaviour, separating from fundamentals (125% or more up in the last 5 years). I said that I could not believe, how gold, crypto, interest rates, inflation and stocks (MicroStrategy ffs, does anyone even care that Saylor was charged with fraud by the SEC in 2000?) could all go up, at the same time, interest rates are like gravity for stocks, but in recent years, no one cares.

I also said, Trump wouldn't win - obviously, the policies make no sense, he's not a good and honest person, he's lying to people and lying to himself, previous criminal indictments, his views on women, promise to pardon criminals, and of course 'wisdom of crowds' - surely everyone will see through it, and all that nonsense - but guess what, he did win, and decisively at that (with Musk's financial assistance), people voted and that's fair. Not only that, after winning the market rallied. I was like huh? Wtf, why, based on which policies, what rationale? What about all the stuff about tariffs? What about tariffs when inflation is already high? What about the S&P 500 being already ridiculously high? Oh it's just a negotiation strategy? How the heck can you even tell?

Cue the banks predicting another 10% rise in 2025 in the S&P 500 index... Based on what? Based on encouraging the retail investors to buy in so you and your clients can sell out?

So anyway, I was already in cash and I'd sold out around Nov time before Trump got elected, and then the market keeps going up and I'm like - 'hey look, as the wise say, you cannot predict the market, and even if you could predict events, you cannot predict the impact those events will have on the market, so you should always be invested, cause you just don't know'.

So slowly, and steadily and reluctantly, I built some stock positions, even though in my gut I'm like, but everything is so expensive, the US administration is doing absolutely crazy stuff which I never thought could even pass, and not only that, I can barely find anything! All the while other folks keep getting gains on stocks. There's a nice dip in Europe in Dec 2024, but that too is reversed swiftly. Anyway, double bluffing myself, ""you never know"", ""you should always be invested"", ""don't try and predict the market, no one can do that"", ""you've been saying this for last couple of years, and look at all the opportunity cost""-  so I still buy what I can over the last few months.  
  
Now hindsight is a wonderful thing, but maybe I was right? Was I? This is the whole thing with this game, even when you're right, you can be wrong, like me - maybe I should have listened to myself, and it takes a lot longer for these predictions to come through that you might think - maybe 2 years even, can I sit around for 2 years just waiting? But what if stocks are up, like 50% since then (which they were until the recent pull back)?  
  
Fortunately, I started reinvesting only a few months ago, and half my portfolio is still in cash earning interest. So although the market is down and who knows how much further it has to go, but there is some consolation and dry powder. By being a little picky  about trying to stick to cheap stocks, I inadvertently built up cash during a time where that would have been the correct strategy.  
  
The S&P500 is down around 3.5% today and I would have been down even more were it not for the cash, and I am down 2.2% today. The average Price to Book Ratio in my portfolio is 0.3. And a lot of them pay dividends and will likely continue to pay dividends even through this period.

Now, I'm not going to sell, cause it'll cost me like 1% to 1.5% or more just to get out of the positions which are already down like 9%, and so with mixed feelings, I have no choice but to ride out whatever this will end up looking like, who knows, a further 'correction'? A bear market? Maybe it could look like 2022? And possibly not, but maybe even 2007?

So I'm sat here, looking at the sea of red in my portfolio, thinking whether I can or can't predict the market, and whether even if I can, do I have the conviction, or will I double bluff myself out of it based on the fact that all my investment gurus tell me that the market cannot be predicted, whilst Buffett builds up his hoard of cash and even sold a chunk his beloved Apple stake which just happens to be down 18.2% YTD.",saying friend family since around entire second half tbh even earlier like year ago like broken record market overpriced weird behaviour separating fundamental last year said could believe gold crypto interest rate inflation stock microstrategy ffs anyone even care saylor charged fraud sec could go time interest rate like gravity stock recent year one care also said trump win obviously policy make sense good honest person lying people lying previous criminal indictment view woman promise pardon criminal course wisdom crowd surely everyone see nonsense guess win decisively musk financial assistance people voted fair winning market rallied like huh wtf based policy rationale stuff tariff tariff inflation already high p already ridiculously high oh negotiation strategy heck even tell cue bank predicting another rise p index based based encouraging retail investor buy client sell anyway already cash sold around nov time trump got elected market keep going like hey look wise say cannot predict market even could predict event cannot predict impact event market always invested cause know slowly steadily reluctantly built stock position even though gut like everything expensive u administration absolutely crazy stuff never thought could even pas barely find anything folk keep getting gain stock nice dip europe dec reversed swiftly anyway double bluffing never know always invested try predict market one saying last couple year look opportunity cost still buy last month hindsight wonderful thing maybe right whole thing game even right wrong like maybe listened take lot longer prediction come might think maybe year even sit around year waiting stock like since recent pull back fortunately started reinvesting month ago half portfolio still cash earning interest although market know much go consolation dry powder little picky trying stick cheap stock inadvertently built cash time would correct strategy p around today would even cash today average price book ratio portfolio lot pay dividend likely continue pay dividend even period going sell cause cost like get position already like mixed feeling choice ride whatever end looking like know correction bear market maybe could look like possibly maybe even sat looking sea red portfolio thinking whether predict market whether even conviction double bluff based fact investment guru tell market cannot predicted whilst buffett build hoard cash even sold chunk beloved apple stake happens ytd,Body,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
valueinvesting,"Hello my friend. Yes, I would definitely have been better off invested, the market has been on a tear (126% in the last 5 years so before the recent pull back). At any point during that time, if my stock picks had checked out, then I would have been better off.

So what had been actually happening last couple of years is me buying a group and then getting skittish and selling; imagine a deer in the African Savannah drinking from a pond or a lake. That's no way to make any real gains. So in 2024 for example doing that, I made 10% ( for context the S&P did 28% over that period), even though there were stocks which I sold which went onto do 90%, not that they all did, but if I had not sold any of them, including the ones that went down 50%, I would have still been OK. I always tended to either sell the entire portfolio or buy an entire portfolio of stocks. I never sold the minus 35% whilst keeping the plus 65% if that makes sense during that skittish period.

As it is well known and well studied and proven over and over, almost everyone (including investment professionals) are better off just indexing.

I like it and I enjoy it and it's kind of like a hobby, and I do spend a lot of time on it, but in terms of rationally, looking back at the last 5 years, I would be better indexing without a doubt. Even now, anyone who has not outperformed the index in the last 5 years alone, would have a mountain to climb just to catch up taking into account the compounding effects going forward between the index gains and their own performance.

“Zooming out, data from JPMorgan shows the value of remaining invested over the course of 20 years. Based on $10,000 invested in the S&P 500 from July 2004 to July 2024:

Recession, tariffs, and inflation have suddenly become mainstream media’s focus again. It seems like all news are bad news which keep sending the market lower.

Let’s take a step back and look at some articles post Trump’s election victory just last November:

**NBC**

[Stocks soar after decisive Trump victory](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stocks-soar-decisive-trump-victory-rcna178921)

""*Trump is poised to enact or extend tax cuts and promote deregulation that investors see as a catalyst for the business community. Stocks soar after decisive Trump victory""*

**Reuters**

[Stocks surge to record highs as Trump returns to presidency | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/sp-500-futures-soar-record-high-after-trump-claims-victory-2024-11-06/)

**LA times**

[U.S. stocks soar as Trump's victory is met with investor enthusiasm - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-11-06/markets-reaction-to-election-results)

*""A Trump presidency could result in lower corporate taxes and more deregulation.""*

Fast forwarding 6 months to now, the market is tumbling as people fear his love for tariffs, a focus of his election campaign, will drag the US into recession. Some even fear we will see a Great Depression 2.0.

All of this reminds me of a quote from Howard Marks’s Mastering The Market Cycle:

 *“…for how many of the 47 years from 1970 through 2016 was the annual return on the S&P 500 within 2% of “normal”—that is, between 8% and 12%? I expected the answer to be “not that often,” but I was surprised to learn that it had happened only three times! It also surprised me to learn that the return had been more than 20 percentage points away from “normal”—either up more than 30% or down more than 10%—more than one-quarter of the time: 13 out of the last 47 years. So one thing that can be said with total conviction about stock market performance is that the average certainly isn’t the norm.* ***Market fluctuations of this magnitude aren’t nearly fully explained by the changing fortunes of companies, industries or economies. They’re largely attributable to the mood swings of investors.****”*

Nobody knows for sure the exact effect of tariffs, nor who will end up paying for them, but it sure as hell seems like people only think things will only get worse from here.

Does this headline look something similar to what you’ve seen recently?

 [More than 1,000 economists warn Trump his trade views echo 1930s errors | Donald Trump | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/03/donald-trump-trade-economists-warning-great-depression)

*""President’s ‘economic protectionism’ harkens back to errors that fueled Great Depression, say experts including 14 Nobel winners. More than 1,000 economists warn Trump his trade views echo 1930s errors""* 

It’s actually an article from May 2018. US inflation rate in 2018 and 2019 was 2.4% and 1.8% respectively. We did not see a recession until Covid hit in 2020, which no one has expected.

All I wanted to say is there will always be uncertainties and something to fear about in the market. Two main risks when it comes to investing: 1) Losing money 2) Missing out good investment opportunities.

valueinvesting,"Banco Santander (SAN) vs. Buffett & Graham Investment Principles

Introduction:
This report evaluates Banco Santander S.A. (NYSE: SAN) against the value-investing principles of Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. We analyze Santander’s long-term fundamentals and current market positioning in the context of: (1) business fundamentals (competitive advantage, simplicity, global reach), (2) financial strength (capital ratios, earnings, margins, leverage), (3) valuation (P/E, P/B, dividend yield, margin of safety), (4) management quality (capital allocation, insider alignment, strategy), and (5) prevailing market conditions (interest rates, European economy, regulation, sentiment). Each section compares Santander’s metrics to classic Buffett/Graham benchmarks.

1. Business Fundamentals

Durable Competitive Advantage: Banco Santander is one of the world’s largest retail and commercial banks, with 173 million customers across Europe and the Americas. This massive scale and global franchise give it a broad, diversified footprint, operating in both developed markets (Spain, UK, U.S.) and emerging markets (Brazil, Latin America). Such diversification across economies and interest rate environments provides stability and resilience in earnings over economic cycles. Scale is a key advantage – Santander’s leadership notes that its global scale enables it to build proprietary technology platforms, reducing costs and improving customer service, which is “a key competitive advantage” for the bank. A wide deposit base and trusted brand built over decades further contribute to a potential economic moat in core markets.

Business Model Simplicity: Santander’s business model is primarily straightforward banking services – it focuses on retail and commercial banking (its largest segment), complemented by consumer finance, corporate & investment banking, wealth management, and payments ￼. In essence, it gathers deposits and makes loans, alongside related financial services, which is an understandable model. However, the complexity lies in its geographic span and multiple segments – it’s a “sprawling… fragmented lender” that Executive Chair Ana Botín has been working to make “leaner [and] simpler” since 2014 ￼. The bank’s ongoing “One Transformation” program is aimed at integrating operations and digital platforms across countries, indicating management’s intent to streamline the business. While a multi-national bank is inherently more complex than a single-market operation, Santander’s core activities remain in familiar banking lines, which Buffett can generally understand (Buffett has invested in large banks, though usually U.S.-focused ones). The durability of Santander’s business is evident in its 165+ year history and ability to adapt to new markets, though its global scope adds layers of operational complexity that Buffett would scrutinize carefully.

Global Footprint & Moat: Santander’s global footprint provides a form of risk mitigation and competitive edge. By operating in varied markets, the bank benefits from different interest-rate cycles and macro trends, which has “provided performance stability and good earnings generation over several economic and interest-rate cycles”. For example, economic slowdowns in Europe can be offset by growth in Latin America, and vice versa. This diversified model can be seen as a moat through scale and distribution: few banks have such an extensive network across continents. However, as Buffett would note, a true moat also requires something competitors can’t easily replicate – Santander’s moat is primarily its entrenched market positions (e.g. top-three bank in Spain, Portugal, UK, Brazil, etc.) and cost advantages from scale. Graham, who favored stable and simple businesses, would appreciate the bank’s dominant retail market share but might be wary of the complexity of managing far-flung operations. Overall, Santander’s business fundamentals show a durable franchise with global reach, a generally simple banking model (with some complexity due to scale), and efforts to strengthen its competitive advantage through technology and efficiency. These qualities align moderately well with Buffett’s focus on a “simple and understandable, yet durable” business, and with Graham’s preference for companies with established market positions.

2. Financial Strength

Capital Adequacy & Leverage: Santander exhibits solid financial strength by regulatory standards. Its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio – a key measure of bank capitalization – reached 12.8% (fully loaded) at the end of 2024. This is comfortably above regulatory minimum requirements (around 8-9%) and reflects a strengthened capital base (up from 12.3% a year prior). Fitch Ratings notes that while Santander’s risk-weighted capital ratios are slightly lower than some European peers, they are “adequate relative to regulatory minimums” and are supported by strong organic capital generation. The bank intends to maintain CET1 ≈12%+ even after forthcoming Basel III “end-game” rule changes. In practical terms, a 12-13% CET1 indicates a healthy buffer against losses and moderate leverage for a global bank. Santander’s asset leverage (assets/equity) is typical for a large bank, but importantly its loan-to-deposit ratio is about 108%, indicating it largely uses stable customer deposits to fund lending (a conservative funding profile) and isn’t over-reliant on risky wholesale borrowing. Both Buffett and Graham prioritize strong balance sheets; here Santander’s capital and liquidity position appears robust, which would satisfy Graham’s conservative bent and Buffett’s requirement that banks “do not bet the farm” with excessive leverage.

Earnings Consistency: Consistent profitability is crucial for both value investors. Santander has delivered improving earnings in recent years (aside from the 2020 pandemic shock). In 2024, the bank posted a record net profit of €12.57 billion, up 14% from 2023, marking the third consecutive year of record results. Earnings per share (EPS) rose to approx. €0.77 in 2024 (from €0.65 in 2023) ￼ ￼. Return on tangible equity (RoTE) reached 16.3%, and return on (total) equity was around 13% ￼ – a solid profitability level. These figures indicate that Santander is earning good returns on shareholders’ capital, a positive sign for Buffett (who often looks for ROE consistently above ~12%). Profit margins have been healthy as well: net profit margin was about 20% in 2024, up from prior years ￼, reflecting efficient operations. The bank’s cost-to-income ratio improved to 41.8% – its best efficiency in 15 years – meaning it spends only €0.42 to earn €1 of revenue. This efficiency ratio is quite favorable for a large bank and highlights tight expense control (a trait Buffett likes to see in management).

It’s worth noting that in 2020 Santander incurred a loss (due to hefty loan-loss provisions and goodwill impairments during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to a net loss that year) ￼. However, the rapid rebound in 2021 and beyond suggests that loss was an anomaly. Benjamin Graham typically insisted on a decade of uninterrupted earnings – Santander’s lone loss in 2020 might be a blemish, but given the extraordinary circumstances and the bank’s return to profitability, a Graham-style analyst might forgive it if the underlying earnings power remains intact (which Santander’s subsequent performance demonstrates). Buffett, too, would likely examine the underlying cause of the 2020 loss; seeing that it was largely a one-time write-down and that core operating profits remained positive, he might remain comfortable with Santander’s earnings resiliency.

Asset Quality & Risk Management: Santander’s financial strength is also reflected in its asset quality and prudent risk management. As of end-2024, impaired loans (non-performing loans) were roughly 3.1% of total loans, and are expected to stay under 4% even in a slight economic downturn. Loan-loss provisions actually fell by 1% in 2024 due to solid credit quality, low unemployment, and favorable conditions. The cost of risk (loan loss allowances as a percentage of loans) improved to 1.15%, indicating that losses on loans are low relative to the loan book. Fitch affirms Santander’s “sound risk control framework” and notes the bank has been reducing its risk appetite, which should lead to lower credit losses over time. Such disciplined risk management aligns with the conservative ethos that Graham espoused. For Buffett, the key in banks is avoiding excessive risk – Santander’s diversified loan portfolio and stable credit metrics suggest a conservative risk profile (especially compared to investment banks or more volatile lenders).

In summary, Santander’s financial strength appears solid: well-capitalized (CET1 ~12-13%), consistently profitable with improving ROE and margins, and prudent in risk management. These factors would largely meet Buffett’s criteria for a financially strong company (he wants banks with high capital ratios and steady earnings) and Graham’s standards for conservative financial condition (e.g. moderate leverage and uninterrupted dividends – Santander has continued paying dividends aside from a regulatory pause in 2020). The bank’s ability to earn ~13% ROE while trading near book value also highlights an important Buffett point: if a bank can sustain a high ROE, buying it at or below book value is attractive.

3. Valuation

Price-to-Earnings (P/E): Santander’s stock (ADR SAN) is trading at a single-digit P/E ratio, which is appealing from a value investing standpoint. The trailing twelve-month P/E is about 8.1 ￼, based on an EPS of ~$0.83. Forward-looking estimates put the 2025 P/E around 7.6× ￼ given expected earnings growth. This is well below the overall market average P/E and comfortably below Graham’s classic threshold of 15× for value stocks. In fact, Graham’s value formula (which often considers the product of P/E and P/B) would find Santander very attractive: with P/E ≈8 and P/B <1, the stock’s valuation metrics are far below the typical cutoff (Graham often looked for P/E * P/B < 22.5) ￼. For Buffett, a low P/E alone isn’t sufficient – but it does indicate a potentially undervalued stock relative to earnings power, which provides a margin of safety if those earnings are sustainable.

Price-to-Book (P/B): The stock is also priced below its book value. Santander’s P/B is approximately 0.9× (i.e. the market price is about 90% of its book value per share) ￼. This means investors are buying assets (and equity) for less than their accounting value – often a hallmark of Graham-style deep value. Graham’s rule of thumb was P/B under 1.5 for defensive stocks, a criterion which Santander easily meets. A sub-1.0 P/B for a profitable bank of Santander’s caliber suggests the market may be discounting it due to macro or historical concerns (e.g. European economy, past crises), rather than current performance. Buffett has bought banks at or below book value (he famously did so with Bank of America during a troubled time) when he believed the franchise and management would produce high future returns. Santander’s case – a ~13% ROE while priced at ~0.9 book – implies an investor buying today gets a “yield” on book of ~14% (since ROE/book price ≈ 13%/0.9). That’s an attractive earnings yield that a value investor would note.

Dividend Yield: Santander offers a dividend yield that adds to its valuation appeal. Based on the latest payouts, the trailing dividend yield is about 2.4% ￼ (this figure reflects a $0.12 per share interim dividend in late 2024). However, Santander raised its cash dividend by 39% in 2024, and plans further increases, so the forward annual yield is higher. For 2024, the total dividend per share was roughly €0.195 (about $0.21) ￼, which at the current share price gives a yield of ~3.0-3.5%. Market forecasts peg the 2025 yield around 3.5% ￼. This yield is supported by a payout ratio that remains reasonable given the bank’s earnings growth. Graham liked companies that pay dividends consistently, as a sign of shareholder-friendly policy and real earnings (Santander has a long history of dividends, though it had to suspend them in 2020 due to regulatory mandates). Buffett is less yield-focused (he doesn’t mind low or no dividend if capital is reinvested well), but he certainly appreciates when a company returns excess cash it cannot deploy effectively. In Santander’s case, the combination of a moderate payout and significant share buybacks (more on that in Management) signals a shareholder-oriented valuation approach.

Margin of Safety (Intrinsic Value): From a value investing perspective, Santander’s current valuation likely offers a margin of safety. The concept of margin of safety is about buying well below a conservative estimate of intrinsic value. Several indicators suggest the stock is undervalued relative to fundamentals: the low P/E and P/B discussed above, as well as analyst price targets and book value. For instance, the average analyst price target for SAN is around $7.15 (about €6.6) ￼ ￼, which is only slightly above recent market prices ~$6.80 – implying the market has already risen close to that target after a strong rally. However, intrinsic value estimates using Graham’s methods or Buffett’s preferred metrics might be higher. A simple Graham valuation (using the Graham Number formula) with EPS ~$0.83 and Book Value ~$7.50 (per ADR) yields a fair value in the double-digits (roughly in the $11-$12 range by one calculation), suggesting the stock could be trading at ~60% of intrinsic value – a considerable margin of safety. Buffett might approach intrinsic value by considering the bank’s sustainable earnings power: if Santander can earn, say, $0.90-$1.00 per share in the next few years (as forecasts indicate) and grow modestly, an 8× earnings multiple is quite low. Even a conservative 12× multiple would put the stock around $10+, or if one believes the bank can compound book value at high single digits, the book value in a few years could be well above the current price. These are signs of undervaluation provided Santander’s fundamentals remain intact.

Of course, value investors also ask “why is it cheap?” to ensure no hidden dangers. In Santander’s case, part of the discount is due to it being a European bank (a sector long out of favor relative to U.S. banks), with concerns about Europe’s economy and historically low interest rates. Additionally, Santander’s complexity and past issues (like the 2020 loss, and an acquisition-heavy history) might make some investors apply a cautious discount. However, given the bank’s recent performance and strengthened financials, those discounts may be unwarranted going forward. Investor sentiment is improving (Santander’s ADR rose ~41% in the last 12 months ￼), yet the valuation remains in value territory. This scenario – strong fundamentals, improving outlook, but still low valuation multiples – is exactly the kind of opportunity classic value investors seek. Benjamin Graham’s approach would flag SAN as a potentially undervalued stock meeting his criteria (low P/E, low P/B, reasonable dividend, ample size and assets), thus likely passing a Graham-style screen. Warren Buffett might not be as excited about a large European bank unless he sees a unique competitive edge, but purely on valuation, even Buffett has noted that well-run banks can be very attractive when they trade near or below book value. In summary, Santander’s valuation is favorable: it provides a significant margin of safety and meets key value thresholds, aligning well with Buffett and Graham’s emphasis on buying a great (or at least good) company at a cheap price.

4. Management and Governance

Capital Allocation: Santander’s management has demonstrated shareholder-friendly capital allocation, which is a positive under both Buffett’s and Graham’s lenses. In 2024, Santander not only increased its cash dividend sharply (+39%), but also announced substantial share buybacks. The bank plans to return €10 billion to shareholders via buybacks over 2025 and 2026 (funded by excess capital and earnings). It initiated a new buyback program equal to ~25% of H2 2024 profits. These buybacks, on top of the regular dividends, signal that management believes the stock is undervalued (a buyback only creates value if repurchasing below intrinsic value – a point Buffett often makes). By shrinking the share count (Santander’s shares outstanding have decreased from ~17.3 billion in 2019 to 15.1 billion in 2024 ￼), earnings per share and book value per share are boosted for remaining shareholders. This kind of disciplined capital return is something Buffett highly appreciates – he has often praised companies that return cash they can’t effectively reinvest, and he himself has invested in banks that were repurchasing stock at discounts to book. Graham also liked share buybacks as a use of surplus capital when a stock was cheap, since it increases the ownership stake of remaining shareholders. Overall, Santander’s recent capital actions show prudent allocation: maintaining strong capital ratios while meaningfully distributing excess to shareholders.

Insider Alignment: Governance at Santander has a distinctive element – it is a family-influenced bank, run by the Botín family for four generations. The current Executive Chair, Ana Botín, is the great-granddaughter of the bank’s founder and has led the bank since 2014 ￼. This long-term ownership perspective can align management’s interests with shareholders, as the family’s legacy and wealth are tied to the bank’s success. Ana Botín herself owns a stake (for example, she held about 0.12% of shares in 2021, valued at ~€92 million at the time) ￼ and has demonstrated confidence by purchasing additional shares when they were depressed ￼. Such insider buying is a strong positive signal – it suggests management believes the stock is undervalued and that they are willing to put their own money into it. High insider ownership and purchases align with Buffett’s principle of having “skin in the game” (Buffett likes owner-operators and often says he invests in people who think like owners). Graham too would be comforted by insider buying as it often precedes stock outperformance and indicates faith in the company’s future.

Leadership Quality and Long-Term Strategy: Under Ana Botín’s leadership, Santander has been pursuing a strategy to modernize and streamline operations while leveraging its global scale. She moved to transform Santander “into a global financial platform” and improve efficiency as soon as she took the helm ￼. Over the past decade, she has revamped management (more than half of senior managers are now non-Spanish, bringing international expertise) ￼ and invested in technology and digital banking. The bank’s strategy emphasizes digital integration and innovation – building common IT platforms and fintech capabilities across its markets – to improve customer experience and reduce costs. This is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in an industry facing fintech disruption. Santander’s recent results (record profits, improved efficiency) suggest management’s strategy is gaining traction. The bank is also disciplined in its market presence: it has refocused on key markets (for instance, it rebalanced its U.S. business and is growing high-return segments like its Digital Consumer Bank).

Another aspect of management quality is how they handle risk and growth trade-offs. Santander appears to be choosing sustainable growth over aggressive expansion – Fitch notes a “reduced risk appetite” and better risk governance across the group. This conservative stance is very much in line with how Buffett would run a bank. The days of Santander’s empire-building acquisitions have slowed; instead of big acquisitions, the bank is focusing on organic growth and bolt-on additions, which tend to be lower risk. Santander’s leadership has also shown adaptability – e.g., navigating Brexit impacts on its UK arm, high inflation in Latin America, and the low-rate environment in Europe, all while increasing profits.

Management Reputation: It’s worth noting that despite these efforts, Santander’s stock had lagged for much of Ana Botín’s tenure (as of Sept 2024, shares were down ~30% since 2014 when she took over) ￼, trailing some European rivals. Part of this underperformance was due to external factors (negative interest rates in Europe, emerging market volatility, and COVID impacts), but it also underscores that the market was not fully convinced about Santander’s transformation. Botín herself has expressed frustration that investors haven’t “properly appreciated” Santander’s diversified business mix ￼. However, she remains committed to her strategy and evidently is not complacent – a former advisor noted “she’s never satisfied… always thinks the bank can do better” ￼. This relentless drive can be a positive trait in a leader, as complacency is dangerous in banking. In 2024, as interest rates rose and European banks came back in favor, Santander’s stock finally rallied strongly, suggesting improved sentiment (and perhaps belated recognition of the bank’s improvements).

From a governance perspective, having a powerful family figure at the top can be a double-edged sword: on one hand, it provides stability and long-term orientation (which Buffett often likes; he’s partnered with families before, appreciating their commitment), but on the other hand, it can raise questions on succession and oversight. Santander’s board and governance structures are in place, and the bank has generally avoided major scandals. There was an incident in 2018-2019 where Santander retracted a CEO job offer to a high-profile banker, which drew some criticism to Botín’s decision-making, but that was a one-off event. By and large, Santander’s management appears competent, shareholder-aligned, and focused on long-term value creation – qualities that resonate with Buffett’s and Graham’s philosophies. Graham placed slightly less emphasis on qualitative management factors (unless there were red flags), but Buffett famously invests only in management teams he trusts. In Santander’s case, the commitment to return capital, insiders buying shares, and strategic clarity would check many of Buffett’s boxes.

5. Market Conditions and Outlook

No company operates in a vacuum, and this is especially true for banks like Santander. Market conditions – interest rates, economic growth, regulation, and investor sentiment – greatly influence whether Santander is a good fit for a value investor at this time.

Interest Rate Environment: The period of 2022-2024 saw rising interest rates globally, which has been beneficial for banks’ net interest income. Santander capitalized on this: in 2024 its net interest income (NII) rose 8% year-over-year, as higher rates widened the spread between what it earns on loans and what it pays on deposits. European banks, after years of ultra-low or negative rates, finally enjoyed improving margins. Looking ahead to 2025, interest rates in Europe (set by the ECB) are elevated but may have peaked; some forecasts even suggest slight rate declines if inflation comes under control. Fitch notes that “falling interest rates” in certain markets are expected, but Santander’s balanced exposure and hedging strategies help manage rate volatility. In practice, if rates stay high or gradually decline, Santander should maintain strong interest margins: its diversified global footprint means in some regions (e.g. Latin America) rates might start coming down (reducing loan yields but also lowering funding costs), whereas in Europe/US rates might plateau at a profitable level. Importantly, Santander has shown pricing power on deposits – it kept deposit costs relatively low in Europe even as rates rose, thanks to its strong deposit franchise. This helped it expand margins without losing depositors. For a value investor, the question is whether current earnings (boosted by high rates) are sustainable. If rates fell sharply, bank profits could compress. However, central banks are indicating rates will remain above pre-2020 levels for the foreseeable future, and Santander’s own interest rate hedges and diversified loan book should cushion the impact of moderate rate changes. Overall, the rate environment has turned from a headwind (pre-2022) to a tailwind, benefiting Santander’s earnings – a plus for any investor evaluating its future prospects.

European Economic Outlook: Santander’s fortunes are tied to the economies of its core markets, especially Spain, Brazil, the UK, and the U.S. As of early 2025, the European economic outlook is mixed but generally stable. Growth in the Eurozone is modest; high inflation has been a concern but is gradually easing, and unemployment remains relatively low (Spain, for instance, has seen improving employment which supports loan repayments). Santander’s home market of Spain and much of Europe faces moderating growth – not a recession per se, but slower expansion. Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, etc.) has had higher growth and interest rates, contributing strongly to Santander’s profits, though those economies can be more volatile. The U.K. (another major market via Santander UK) had a tougher 2023 with high inflation, but is stabilizing. A value investor will consider macro risks: for Santander, key risks include a potential recession in Europe (which would increase loan defaults), currency fluctuations (e.g., a weak euro or emerging-market currencies affecting earnings when consolidated), and political/regulatory changes (like bank taxes or stricter rules). On the positive side, Santander’s diversification acts as insurance – weakness in one region may be offset by strength elsewhere. For example, if Europe slows, the bank’s Americas operations (which now contribute about half of profits) could carry the growth, and vice versa. This balanced exposure was highlighted by Fitch as underpinning profitability “through economic and interest rate cycles”. Buffett typically prefers companies that can thrive across economic cycles; Santander has shown it can remain profitable even in low-rate or high-inflation scenarios due to its spread of markets, which is encouraging.

Regulatory Climate: Banking is a heavily regulated industry, and changes here directly impact Santander’s investment thesis. In the post-2008 era, banks must hold higher capital and face stricter oversight. For a while, this suppressed dividends and growth (e.g., the European Central Bank temporarily banned bank dividends in 2020’s pandemic shock). Now, however, Santander operates in a more supportive regulatory climate: it meets capital requirements with buffer to spare, and regulators have lifted constraints on capital returns (hence Santander’s aggressive buybacks). Upcoming regulations (the finalization of Basel III rules around 2025-2026) will slightly increase risk-weighted assets, effectively requiring banks to hold a bit more capital. Santander has planned for this and is confident it can keep CET1 ≥ 12% through that transition. Additionally, Santander underwent U.S. Federal Reserve stress tests for its U.S. subsidiary and managed to operate within required capital buffers. This all suggests regulatory risk is manageable. One area to watch is any additional taxes or windfall levies – Spain imposed a temporary banking tax in 2023-2024 due to high inflation (to make banks “share” the burden of higher rates); Santander has navigated these without major issue, but such measures can affect profits. Generally, though, Santander’s scale and compliance culture (shaped by global regulators in Europe, UK, US, Brazil, etc.) indicate it’s in good standing. For Buffett and Graham, a stable regulatory environment that the bank can comfortably meet is essential – they wouldn’t want an investment that could be derailed by capital shortfalls or legal troubles. In this regard, Santander appears to be on solid regulatory footing, even earning a credit rating upgrade to ‘A’ in early 2025 from Fitch, reflecting increased confidence in its financial stability.

Investor Sentiment and Market Perception: Perhaps one of the biggest considerations for a value investor is the current market sentiment towards Santander and whether it contrarianly creates an opportunity. For much of the past decade, investor sentiment towards European banks was lukewarm – low growth and various crises kept valuations down. Santander was no exception; as noted, its share price languished for years and traded at a discount to peers. However, 2024 marked a turning point: European banks’ earnings surged with higher rates, and their stocks rallied. Santander’s U.S.-listed shares rose over 40% in the last year ￼, outperforming many U.S. bank stocks and broader indices. This rally suggests investors are starting to recognize Santander’s improved fundamentals. That said, valuation remains low (P/B ~0.9, P/E ~8) – indicating that while sentiment improved, it’s not exuberant. The stock is possibly still pricing in a degree of caution or skepticism. This is exactly what a value investor looks for: a company doing well fundamentally but still somewhat “unloved” or underpriced relative to its true worth.

Buffett often speaks of being greedy when others are fearful. Are others fearful or indifferent to Santander? There’s evidence that despite better results, many U.S. investors remain underexposed to European banks. Also, Europe’s slower growth and the bank’s emerging-market exposure can scare off more risk-averse investors. For Graham-style deep value investors, however, these wide discounts can be an opportunity, provided one has analyzed the risks properly. In Santander’s case, the “margin of safety” is evident in the numbers, and the improving trend in performance provides confidence. Investor sentiment could further improve if Santander continues delivering on its targets (the bank is aiming for >17% RoTE in 2025 and even higher shareholder distributions). On the flip side, one must note that banking is inherently cyclical and exposed to external shocks. A sudden spike in unemployment, a financial crisis, or geopolitical event (for example, a debt crisis in a Latin American country or escalation of conflict in Europe) could hurt Santander’s prospects and stock price. Value investors demand a margin of safety because such uncertainties exist. The question to answer is whether Santander’s current price more than discounts those risks. Given its strong capital, diversification, and low valuation, the downside risk appears limited (barring an extreme crisis), while the upside could be significant if the bank simply maintains its current earnings trajectory.

Market Conditions Summary: The macro environment for Santander as of 2025 is cautiously favorable – interest rates are high (good for income) but may stabilize, economies are growing slowly but not contracting, and regulators are ensuring banks stay prudent but are allowing them to reward shareholders. Investor sentiment is improving but hasn’t bid the stock up to an expensive level. These conditions create a scenario where a Buffett or Graham investor sees a fundamentally solid bank in a reasonable macro environment that the market hasn’t fully revalued yet. Buffett has invested in banks when he perceives an inflection in their profitability and sentiment (e.g., his investment in Bank of America post-2011). Similarly, Graham’s best-known investments often involved buying into sectors that were out of favor but fundamentally sound. Santander seems to fit that mold: a strong franchise in an industry that is recovering in the public eye but still priced for caution. As long as interest rates don’t collapse and economies don’t enter a severe recession, Santander’s earnings power should remain robust in the near term, supporting the investment case.

Conclusion & Summary of Santander vs. Value Investing Benchmarks

In conclusion, Banco Santander (SAN) exhibits many of the qualities that Buffett and Graham look for, though with some caveats. It has a durable, globally diversified franchise (albeit more complex than a purely domestic business) and has achieved steady improvements in profitability and efficiency. The bank is financially strong, with adequate capital and conservative risk management, supporting consistent dividends and buybacks. Critically, the stock’s valuation is low relative to its fundamentals, providing a margin of safety that Benjamin Graham would applaud. Management is taking shareholder-friendly actions and has skin in the game, aligning with Buffett’s principles of owner-oriented leadership. The current market and economic conditions, while not without risks, are generally benefiting Santander (through higher interest income and improving sentiment), yet the stock remains priced at value levels.

There are a few considerations: Santander’s sheer size and multi-country operations mean it doesn’t have the utter simplicity of a business that Buffett often prizes (like a single-market dominant player). The bank also operates in regions with varied risks (currency, political, economic), which a value investor must be comfortable with. Additionally, one off-year (2020) showed that even strong banks can be hit by extraordinary events – value investing requires patience and tolerance for such volatility.

On balance, however, Santander appears to meet or exceed many of the benchmarks set by Buffett and Graham for a worthwhile investment. It combines the qualitative aspect of a solid franchise and capable management (Buffett’s focus) with the quantitative aspect of low price relative to assets and earnings (Graham’s focus). Below is a summary table contrasting Santander’s core metrics with typical Buffett/Graham value-investing criteria.

Ultimately, whether Santander is a “buy” comes down to an investor’s comfort with a large global bank in the current environment. Based on this analysis, Santander appears to align well with classic value investing principles: it has the hallmarks of a fundamentally sound business priced with a margin of safety.

valueinvesting,"Hey everyone,

I was recently digging through some stocks and came across one that trades at a valuation that really doesn’t make much sense.

Key Metrics:

* 0.38 book value
* 3.6x earnings
* 20+ years dividend record
* No long-term Debt
* 50% discount to NCAV

The company I‘m talking about is **Deswell Industries (NASDAQ: DSWL)**

Founded in 1987 and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, Deswell Industries is an international and long-established manufacturer operating out of Dongguan, China.

The company specializes in two core segments:

* **Plastic Injection, Tooling & Molding** ***(***\~18% of total revenue)
* **Electronic Product Development & Manufacturing.** (\~82% of total revenue)

Deswell supplies components and finished products to original equipment manufacturers around the world, serving customers across the U.S., Europe, Canada, the UK, and Asia.

In short: this is a global operator, quietly doing essential pre-production work behind the scenes.

What caught my eye about Deswell wasn’t its income statement—even though Deswell is a consistently profitable, well-managed operator..

It generates solid returns, pays a healthy dividend, and reinvests intelligently.

And while that’s good to see, it’s not even the main reason DSWL seems to be undervalued.

The real opportunity lies in the **balance sheet.**

Deswell holds:

* $13.4M in cash
* $52.3M in short-term investments (mostly bonds)
* $11.8M in inventory (very little room for loss via write-offs)
* **Zero** long-term debt

→ That’s $65.7M in liquid assets alone—almost **2x** the current market cap of $36.9M.

That makes DSWL a textbook **Net-Net.**

Here‘s the math:  
NCAV = Total Current Assets – Total Liabilities  
NCAV = $96.1M – $21.7M = $74.4M  
With 15.9M shares outstanding, that’s $4.70 per share in NCAV.  
The stock trades at **$2.32**.

So it's essentially trading for less than half of what it’s worth if it shut down and liquidated tomorrow.

**Ownership:** One thing about Deswell that seems concerning at first glance—but isn’t necessarily a problem if you look deeper—is its heavy insider ownership.

Just two members of management control over 70% of the outstanding shares.  
The largest stake belongs to Wai Ming Lau, who holds 61.8% and currently serves as Chair of the Board.

At first, this made me really nervous—giving that much power to one person is always a risk.  
But after doing some research on her background and finding out that she worked as Executive Director in the Finance Division at Goldman Sachs, I was actually pretty pleased.

**Risks:** There are two things I don’t really like about DSWL:

1. **Customer concentration** – As of 2024, Deswell’s top four customers account for 45.4% of total revenue. That’s a lot of dependency. That said, this isn’t new. The company has long relied on a small number of customers and expects to continue doing so.
2. **China exposure** – Even though Deswell feels more like an international operator than your typical “China stock,” most of its operations still run out of China. That might make you think Trump’s new sanctions would’ve impacted the company or the stock price—but they haven’t. After digging deeper, I found out why: Deswell isn’t really dependent on the U.S. market. The U.S. is just its fifth-largest market, accounting for only around 10% of total sales. So sanctions or trade tensions don’t carry that much weight here. 

Yes, Deswell isn’t flashy. It’s not a tech rocket ship.

But that’s the point.

This is a simple, stable, cash-rich business trading at a level that makes no real sense: a 50% discount to its liquidation value, with consistent earnings, no debt, and decades of operational history behind it.

**Executive Summary**

ECO Animal Health (AIM: EAH) trades below (technical) liquidation value, with a debt-free balance sheet funding an R&D pipeline that should begin to materialise in 2026. Management’s shift toward capitalising development costs signals growing confidence in future drug approvals, yet the market prices this pipeline at zero. If late-stage assets succeed, shares could rerate rapidly.

**Introduction**

ECO Animal Health is an AIM-listed UK-based company with a global presence, specialising in developing and marketing pharmaceuticals for pigs and poultry. Their products focus on improving animal health, preventing disease and enhancing productivity for farmers. It may not exciting work, but it’s very necessary.

When I say “global,” the revenue split as of most recent results is: China + Japan (28%), LatAm (22%), NAM (21%), S&SE Asia (19.6%), Europe (7%). It’s worth noting that Chinese and Japanese sales fell 15% in the first half of 2025 (compared to the previous year) due to low disease incidence which resulted in ECO shares tumbling 30% in the Winter last year. 

Regardless of China/Japan woes, at a glance, ECO still seems to be a lifeless company. Profits are basically zero and share option schemes dilute shareholders by a couple percent annually. There’s little to be excited about. To make it abundantly clear, over the past five years the shares are down 72% and optimism is down because in a time of political/economic uncertainty (Trump (US) and Reeves(UK)) no-one wants to invest in a nanocap company with front-loaded costs… 

**Valuation**

As of the latest results, ECO trades at less than its “net-net” value (i.e working capital less all liabilities) of £41.6m at £40m. I mention this, not because I hope the company liquidates, because it acts as a rough “margin of safety.” (If the company did liquidate, as you'll see for reasons explained below, this value would *not* get realised.)

A better proxy for value would be if we assume that management have been prudent when capitalising R&D (discussed below), ECO have intangible assets of £20.2m after amortisation of which £12.7m relates to Aivlosin and £7m relates to vaccines. This adjusts book value to £62.4m which I believe to be a truer private market value of ECO – in the words of management themselves, the market values ECO’s R&D pipeline at zero.

Perhaps (deep) value investors will point to the £18.3m cash on the balance sheet (as of H1 25) which is likely to be understated (today) based on the second half weighting of sales. Given the debt-free balance sheet, we can say that EV is conservatively £22m – for a company that has “generated” EBITDA of £6m (on average) in the last three years. That certainly seems cheap!

This thinking is flawed for two reasons – firstly, only £6.9m of that cash is held in the UK (as of H1 25), with the majority held in China (which cannot be repatriated unless it's in the form of dividends). It is worth noting that cash used for R&D is also that UK cash meaning that the strong liquidity that management boast about is not completely accurate – this becomes truer when you consider they have plans to spend over £20m on new developments. 

Secondly, EBITDA is a completely the wrong metric to follow even if management continue to “headline” that figure in presentations and press releases. The reason for this is logical – R&D can be expensed or capitalised and investors must be familiar with the accounting. 

**R&D Accounting + Earnings Power Discussion**

The “R” (research) must always be expensed immediately but the “D” development may be capitalised only if the following (strict) criteria is met:



1. The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.  
2. Its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.  
3. Its ability to use or sell the intangible asset.  
4. How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, the entity can demonstrate the existence of a  market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset.  
5. The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.  
6. Its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 



For this reason, when evaluating ECO Animal Health, it makes sense to add back amortisation. However, deducting interest, taxes and depreciation makes very little sense to me. Therefore, it would seem that the best way to look at ECO’s financials is to take ordinary post-tax EPS and add back the amortisation. However, even then, this approach is aggressive because it still might overstate the company's true economic earnings if some capitalised projects fail to deliver value.

Therefore, it would seem that EPS is the best way to look at ECO Animal Health – which explains the share price deterioration (in spite of the “rock solid” balance sheet). 

However, this is still superficial analysis because the whole purpose of (expensed) R&D is to benefit in the longer term future from today’s costs. To me, it's logical to think of expensed R&D as higher risk (but very necessary) uses of cash that likely won't yield any returns in the near future and capitalised R&D as lower risk, nearer term (but still far from certain) investments, reflected by the current amortisation expense. The problem is that the accounting doesn't do the reality justice and therefore tracking future costs on today’s income statement continues to make little sense. Really, it is really the “quality of R&D” that ought to be thought about. 

**R&D Trends & Capitalisation Shift**

As a percentage of sales, ECO’s R&D expenditures seems to be in the normal range (8-12% is the norm). However, it’s important to note ECO’s lack of scale that results in much lower margins compared to larger competitors which also results in multiples that are compressed. One private investor voiced concerns to me that ECO could easily get bought out by a larger competitor for double the price (and still be undervalued!). Whilst I hope this doesn’t happen, I do agree that it would make sense for competitors to start circling and inorganically develop their own R&D pipeline. 

The real solution for investors is to look back into the past and hone in on the R&D figures. If we completely ignore that difference between capitalised/expensed R&D and look at the total figures, you’ll notice that there are clear trends in R&D expenditure – in the last six years, average R&D expenditure was £9.35m (totalled £56.1m) of which expensed R&D has totalled £41.6m (average of £6.9m) and capitalised R&D has totalled £14.5m (average of £2.41m). Given the capitalisation requirements above, it’s understandable why it has been skewed this way. The problem is that this £56m R&D cost has resulted in no topline growth and no EPS growth. Why would this time be any different? 

Firstly, I have to give some credit to management in that they’ve stuck to their strategy. They’ve been quite clear that 2026/27 is where we begin to see topline growth. Of course, demanding patience from investors is tricky. Ironically, as everything is starting to become more “real”, the hope surrounding the stock has declined providing an opportunity for aware, astute investors. 

Secondly (and more importantly to me), the striking trend to me is capitalisation as a percentage of total R&D which has grown from 11% in FY2021 (£1m capitalisation) to 49% in FY2024 (£4.1m capitalisation). And this one financial statistic can be deemed the crux of my bet – more capitalisation signals more certainty and more certainty means more likely success in drugs. From there, it’s more obvious – a larger portfolio of drugs means more revenue and so on… 

This was explicitly confirmed in the 2024 CFO's report, too, which is why I'm surprised the stock has not already begun to rerate: 

*The two mycoplasma projects for vaccination of poultry continued to be capitalised...*  *portion capitalised was 50% compared with 29% in the prior year... due to the late stage phase of development of the poultry  mycoplasma projects, the commencement  of the capitalisation of the costs incurred  on the EcoFlor project (now in the final  development phase) and the costs of running the late-stage trials.*  

(Note that in the interim H1 2025 results, the trend moved down slightly to 57% expense:43% capitalisation but this is actually broadly in line with the H1 2024 results. We will have to wait for the FY 2025 results before making proper judgements.)

Now, I view this trend as the difference between now and a few years ago. But it could be that management are aggressively capitalising (what should be) expenses. However, the market hasn’t even considered this yet (shares are worth far less what they were a few years ago). Therefore, I don’t feel viewing this as bullish is wrong. Furthermore, CFO, Chris Wilks was appointed in 2019 – there’s some consistency here (i.e he only started to capitalise as ECO got closer to submissions) and I don’t think he’s necessarily “pushing” the numbers.  

This has been indirectly echoed by management in recent conferences and events with them telling investors to expect more RNS notifications (related to submissions of vaccines). So, if that’s true, it begs the question from shareholders “If confident, why don’t you (the management) buy shares?” It is true that David Hallas, CEO, has been making purchases on the open market – now owning c.125k shares (worth less than £75k) – but this may be purely to get his shareholding requirement (125% of salary (£343k)) at a reasonable level. 

**Cash Flow & Business Model**

Whilst this is a great sign undoubtedly, can we assume that ECO Animal Health will remain solvent and (if yes) what are the financial fruits of such developments? 

We know that ECO have access to £6.9m cash – but of that some may have to be used for working capital purposes. So call it £5m “free cash.” Cash enters the business through sales of Aivlosin, a veterinary antibiotic primarily used for the treatment and control of respiratory and enteric diseases in swine and poultry, that accounts for about 90% of sales. This makes the current situation quite easy to understand – one product is keeping the business afloat and allowing for further R&D without a capital raise. 

Naturally, questions that need to be asked are is the company efficient with its costs (such that they maximise their investment) and can we assume Aivlosin sales to be stable going forwards? 

Well, the answer to the latter question seems to be yes with management forecasting to low levels of annual growth (such that a decade from now Aivlosin sales are closer to £100m) with R&D focussed on developing ""new"" Aivlosin versions and the sales team trying to penetrate underserved markets. 

(My own opinion is that stability (and not low growth) in revenues is ""good enough"" (for reasons explained in the next paragraph) provided that growth in emerging markets like India and Brazil, combined with increasing global protein demand and complementary new product launches more or less offset declines in challenging markets like China.) 

As for the former question, management breaks down costs very neatly for us. Cost of sales are made up almost entirely of inventories, meaning that we can (roughly) say that £51m of Aivlosin sells for under £90m – a tidy markup of about 75%. The second largest cost is brainpower – 227 employees were paid £17m (£75k average salary). Interestingly, the sales force team declined by 10% between 2023 and 2024. Cost cuts? It’s slightly worrying to me. Having said that the number of people in the Production/Development team increased from 89 to 91. Other administrative cash costs seem to total £9.8m/annum. After that, (average) R&D of £10m/annum, lease liabilities of £885k and an audit of £312k are the only cash costs associated with running the business meaning that the company technically should spin off £1m/annum cash flow before changes in working capital. Therefore, at a (truer) enterprise value of £33m (i.e £39m market cap minus £6m “excess” cash), ECO does seem to be pretty cheap when you factor in an R&D pipeline set to come to market in the next year.  

Another confusing element to ECO Animal Health is the dividend received from subsidiaries and the accounting for such a transaction. The cash flow statement records a £2.8m dividends paid (cash outflow) line item which makes it seem that ECO pay a dividend to shareholders. This isn’t true, of course, as it’s a payment from Chinese subsidiaries to the UK. However, there is no corresponding “receipt” of payment on the financial statements. Perhaps sharper analysts will have figured this all out, but (to me) it was quite confusing and only started to make sense when I spotted the 5% withholding tax paid on dividends. The main point is that analysts ought to realise that there’s no actual cash movement (except it’s going from subsidiary to parent) and it’s good because the exported cash can be used for R&D/other purposes. 

**Management & Strategy**

In presentations to investors, management have lofty ambitions – almost comical if you compare it to the share price. Frankly, if management hit their targets, shareholders will get very rich from this one stock. Even if ECO achieves only 20% of management’s £259m pipeline target, the current valuation would still be absurdly low.  However, this is where it’s understandable/reasonable/rational to be slightly sceptical of such claims. 

The claim was that from an initial £23.5m (development cost) investment, management will turn over £259m and EBITDA of £126m from their R&D pipeline meaning that by 2035 they will be doing revenues of over £350m (i.e their current line of business will grow to £100m). What I found funny about this chart (slide 84: [PowerPoint Presentation](https://ecoanimalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ECO-Animal-Health-RD-Day-2025-Deck.pdf) ) was that 2025’s revenues seem to be quite low (c.£75m from a naked eye) – if that’s a guide for this year, I think shareholders will be in for a shock! I say this in jest, of course, but I really don’t agree with this “marketing pitch” way of communication with shareholders. Long holders of the stock have already suffered enough and may take unkindly to these predictions when they’ve seen nothing tangible and/or positive. 

Despite poor/amusing marketing techniques, management’s overall strategy seems to be correct: 



1. Invest in R&D to develop new products with a focus on swine and poultry and infectious diseases
2. Create partnerships (and make acquisitions – unlikely in my view) to develop core strengths
3. Continue to develop Aivlosin, targeting unexploited territories, species and medical claims



If we briefly talk a little more about management (and the new Chairman), you’ll realise that this is quite a strong team: 



1. David Hallas, CEO – has been in the industry for years at different places from Pfizer to Schering to MSD Animal Health to Sure Petcare. Track record of managing profitable growth through new product introductions and successful merger integrations suggests he is well-suited to lead ECO's next phase of development.
2. Joachim Hasenmaier, new Chairman – spent 19 years at Boehringer Ingelheim within the animal health division. Expertise in leading successful transformations, including the integration of Sanofi's animal health business Merial.
3. Andrew Buglass, CCO – 13 years at Merial, joined ECO in 2011. Experience at Merial from 1998 to 2011, where he held roles ranging from Territory Manager to UK Head of Sales - Livestock, provides him with a solid foundation in the industry.
4. Seamus Long, Operations Director - joined ECO in 2001.
5. Hafid Benchaoui, R&D Director – joined ECO in 2016 from Elanco (Head of Global Research and Technology Acquisitions).



And this is just the leadership. ECO have mentioned that they are actively recruiting young, eager talent.  

Recall that this is a small company so whilst they have the advantages of being nimble, they are also constrained financially which means that they have to be creative (i.e as asset-lite as possible) with getting stuff done. Examples of this include working with Contract Manufacturing Organisation (CMO) to manufacture vaccines and partnering with universities to get specific research done. 

**The Future**

I’ve barely touched on the pipeline because I don’t know exactly what will happen and, frankly, investors don’t need all of ECO’s pipeline to work. Three assets are in their late stages, five are in their clinical stages and two are in their early stages. Suppose two of these late-stage assets work out and one fails (the largest one) – the result is that ECO still increase their (current) revenues by at least £10m annually.  

These late-stage assets are:



1. EcoVaxxin MS - vaccine against Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) in poultry. Reduces air sac lesions and colonisation and foot pad lesions caused by MS. Prevents ovarian regressions and egg production losses caused by MS. It can cause a 5-10% egg reduction and 5-7% hatchability reduction in infected breeder flocks. It is worth noting that on 3/03/2025, ECO [filed ](https://www.investegate.co.uk/announcement/rns/eco-animal-health-group--eah/submission-of-marketing-authorisation-application/8758901)a Marketing Authorisation Application and dossier to the European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") for its MS vaccine, with the formal approval process expected to take c.18 months. (*Financials (management predictions): Peak year revenue of £22m (2034) and EBITDA of £17m.)*  
2. EcoVaxxin MG - vaccine targets Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) in poultry. MG infection results in chronic respiratory disease, reduced feed efficiency, poor uniformity, delayed and reduced egg production and decreased egg hatchability. It is estimated to cause avoidable losses of at least $780 million annually to the global poultry industry. *(Financials: £9.8m peak year revenue (2036) and EBITDA of £3.3m.)*
3. Long-acting Florfenical - florfenicol is a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic used in veterinary medicine. *(Financials: £5.9m peak year revenue (2036) and EBITDA of £3.7m.)*



Note that these predictions by management have not been taken “seriously” by me. If even half of this amounts to be true, given the current valuation, shareholders will be rewarded handsomely. 

I don’t have many problems with management’s capital allocation plans with management even entertaining the possibility of a share buyback at the R&D Day to take selling pressure out of the stock. If executed well, a buyback could be the catalyst the stock needs to attract some buyers. 

**Conclusion**

As I begin to conclude, I will bring some risks to your attention:



1. Single product reliance (Aivlosin) -> mitigated by Aivlosin’s patent expiry resilience. However, already low disease incidence in China has shown its materiality on Aivlosin sales. That said, management will target places where Aivlosin isn’t already prevalent. Furthermore, they have disposed on noncore assets in the past for cash (should they need it). 
2. China cash trapped -> is a problem. Cash can only be exported through dividends so analysts should work out how much can be exported per year to the UK and not focus on the overall number. 
3. R&D all fails resulting in large write-downs on the balance sheet.  However, the downside is capped by net cash and Aivlosin’s cash flow. Furthermore, given that little R&D success is priced into the stock, the downside is limited. 
4. Illiquidity -> average volume is 90k shares (or £70k worth of trades based on the average share price in the last year). Few large investors can buy shares and small investors seem to be afraid of building a reasonably sized position. 



Catalysts:



1. Drugs get clearance -> EcoVaxxin MS Q2 2026 (EU), EcoVaxxin MG Q4 2026 (NAM)
2. Acquisition: a larger company realises the value of the R&D pipeline. 
3. Management buy back shares to shore up stock -> investor confidence
4. Multiple expansion on the back of management success



Inconclusion, most drug manufacturers are riskier because of their high valuation and uncertainty. ECO has that same uncertainty but this valuation seems absurd when you consider that this is not a company saddled with debt or bleeding cash. 

Profits aren’t great today, revenues haven’t really grown in a long time and management aren’t presenting their company in the best way possible. However, the balance sheet and Aivlosin revenues give ECO time to deliver on their diversification strategy. 

Therefore, it’s reasonable to suggest that ECO offers a free option on its pipeline: investors pay nothing for R&D assets while getting Aivlosin’s cash flow and the potential of a nearer-tem takeover. With 2026 catalysts, patience could deliver “multibagger” returns.

Hopefully, you enjoyed this writeup. As usual, feel free to ask questions.

valueinvesting,"# Market Performance

The US stock market ended mixed on March 31, 2025, capping a volatile quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 418 points (1%), while the S&P 500 rose 0.55%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished down slightly by 0.14%. This marked the worst quarter for US markets since 2022, with the S&P 500 down 4.6% for the quarter, the Nasdaq down 10.4%, and the Dow Jones down about 1%.

# Main Reasons for Market Movement

1. **Trump's Impending Tariffs**: Markets have been under pressure ahead of the April 2 ""Liberation Day"" when President Trump is expected to announce sweeping reciprocal tariffs. Trump stated the tariffs would apply to ""all countries,"" creating significant uncertainty. The S&P 500 briefly reentered correction territory early in the day before recovering.
2. **Inflation Concerns**: Recent PCE data showed inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target at 2.8% for core PCE. With Trump's tariffs expected to further elevate prices, Goldman Sachs raised its year-end core PCE inflation forecast to 3.5% and increased its recession probability to 35%.
3. **Federal Reserve Stance**: NY Fed President John Williams stated that interest rates will need to remain steady for ""some time"" as policymakers assess the impact of Trump's tariffs on the economy, noting that tariff effects on inflation could be ""more prolonged"" than initially expected.
4. **Q1 Earnings Expectations**: More companies than usual (68 versus a 5-year average of 57) have issued negative earnings guidance for Q1, indicating corporate concerns about the economic environment.

# Sector and Stock Performance

* **Energy**: Outperformed as oil prices surged 3% after Trump threatened secondary tariffs on Russian oil.
* **Gold**: Hit a record high above $3,150 per ounce, on track for its best quarter since 1986 with a 18% gain.
* **Tech**: Led the market declines with Nvidia down as part of the ""Magnificent Seven"" that have tumbled about 16% this quarter.
* **Consumer Discretionary**: Companies tied to consumers showed weakness, with airline stocks including Delta and United Airlines among the worst performers in the past month (down 27% and 25% respectively).
* **Consumer Staples and Healthcare**: Showed relative strength as investors rotated into defensive positions.

# Investment Firm Perspectives

* **Goldman Sachs**: Cut its year-end S&P 500 target to 5,700 from 6,200 and raised its recession probability to 35% from 20%.
* **Barclays**: Lowered its year-end S&P 500 target to 5,900 from 6,600.
* **Yardeni Research**: Reduced its target to 6,100 from 6,400, citing deteriorating conditions under ""Trump's Reign of Tariffs.""
* **UBS**: Lowered its year-end target to 6,400 from 6,600.
* **Morgan Stanley**: Warned that risks around Friday's upcoming jobs report ""may be asymmetric,"" with little upside potential and significant downside concerns.

# Market Concerns/Optimism

* **Concerns**: Rising stagflation risks (high inflation combined with slowing growth), uncertainty over the scope of tariffs, potential for trade retaliation from other countries, weakening consumer sentiment reaching levels last seen during the 2008 recession, and the highest level of economic policy uncertainty since COVID-19.
* **Optimism**: Strong labor market (still at 4.1% unemployment), potential clarity after Wednesday's tariff announcements could reduce uncertainty, and defensive sectors showing resilience suggesting tactical positioning rather than broad-based selling.

# Outlook

The market faces significant uncertainty in the coming days with Trump's tariff announcements on Wednesday and the March jobs report on Friday being key events. Economists expect the economy to continue growing but at a slower pace than last year, with mounting recession risks. The potential for elevated inflation combined with slowing growth remains a significant concern, with investors closely watching whether high-income consumers can continue to support the economy despite declining consumer sentiment in lower income brackets.",market performance u stock market ended mixed march capping volatile quarter dow jones industrial average gained point p rose tech heavy nasdaq composite finished slightly marked worst quarter u market since p quarter nasdaq dow jones main reason market movement trump impending tariff market pressure ahead april liberation day president trump expected announce sweeping reciprocal tariff trump stated tariff would apply country creating significant uncertainty p briefly reentered correction territory early day recovering inflation concern recent pce data showed inflation remains fed target core pce trump tariff expected elevate price goldman sachs raised year end core pce inflation forecast increased recession probability federal reserve stance ny fed president john williams stated interest rate need remain steady time policymakers ass impact trump tariff economy noting tariff effect inflation could prolonged initially expected q earnings expectation company usual versus year average issued negative earnings guidance q indicating corporate concern economic environment sector stock performance energy outperformed oil price surged trump threatened secondary tariff russian oil gold hit record high per ounce track best quarter since gain tech led market decline nvidia part magnificent seven tumbled quarter consumer discretionary company tied consumer showed weakness airline stock including delta united airline among worst performer past month respectively consumer staple healthcare showed relative strength investor rotated defensive position investment firm perspective goldman sachs cut year end p target raised recession probability barclays lowered year end p target yardeni research reduced target citing deteriorating condition trump reign tariff ubs lowered year end target morgan stanley warned risk around friday upcoming job report may asymmetric little upside potential significant downside concern market concern optimism concern rising stagflation risk high inflation combined slowing growth uncertainty scope tariff potential trade retaliation country weakening consumer sentiment reaching level last seen recession highest level economic policy uncertainty since covid optimism strong labor market still unemployment potential clarity wednesday tariff announcement could reduce uncertainty defensive sector showing resilience suggesting tactical positioning rather broad based selling outlook market face significant uncertainty coming day trump tariff announcement wednesday march job report friday key event economist expect economy continue growing slower pace last year mounting recession risk potential elevated inflation combined slowing growth remains significant concern investor closely watching whether high income consumer continue support economy despite declining consumer sentiment lower income bracket,Body,"['MS', 'GS', 'SPGI']",Banks & Finance

**Market Performance:**

* **Mixed Closing:** The Dow closed significantly up, the S&P 500 slightly up, and the NASDAQ slightly down. This mixed performance reflects uncertainty in the market.
* **Worst Monthly Performance Since March 2020:** Despite the day's gains, major averages are facing their worst monthly performance since March 2020.

**Commodities:**

* **Oil Price Surge:** WTI crude oil experienced its biggest daily gain since President Trump's inauguration, fueled by threats of secondary tariffs on countries importing Russian oil.
* **Gold at All-Time Highs:** Gold reached record highs, driven by several factors including central bank buying, increased investment in gold ETFs, and upward revisions in price targets by analysts. A warning is given that high volatility could lead to sell-offs.

**Biotech:**

* **FDA Official Resignation:** Peter Marx, the FDA's top vaccine regulator, resigned, citing frustrations with the new HHS secretary, RFK Jr. This adds to uncertainty in the biotech sector.
* **Biotech Stock Performance:** Biotech stocks are performing poorly this year, and this resignation further increases concerns.
* **Reshoring Manufacturing?:** President Trump's discussions about bringing biopharmaceutical manufacturing back to the US through tariffs could impact the sector. Vertex and Biogen are mentioned as having minimal international manufacturing.

valueinvesting,"I can't have a debate here on every company. There are reddit threads for that.  The basics are all of these companies are growing rapidly and have great balance sheets. Even AXP and microsoft are growing faster than the average company in the S&P 500. The recent discounts are pricing them as if they are not expected to grow.  Google's PE today is like 15 or something when the entire S&P is still 20. You also have to know that about 14 dollars of google's share price can be deducted directly because they have enough actual cash on hand to account for 14 dollars per share. So its PE is even lower. Amazon is similar when you account for cash on hand. In fact, the crazy thing about amazon is they are spending huge on fairly discretionary AI capex this year and their PE would be ridiculously low without that added 75 billion or something like that. They're not going to spend like that every year. Its a very short term fixed cost. 

 Anyway I actually don't look at PE values that much. I use DCF models with a 11% discount rate and try to see what sort of growth I need to justify the current price and how reasonable it is to expect that growth. I usually start with average S&P 500 company growth of about 7-8% per year and see what happens. I think all of these companies don't need a lot of growth to justify their current price. My DCF model has SMCI at 80 a share with only average S&P500 company growth and its trading at 32, vistra at 170 a share and its trading at 114 today. It had AXP at like 20% upside. I can't remember the rest. But yeah most of them to me look like safe bets at these prices (if you're talking 5+ year time horizon)

The S&P 500 is currently at 25.6. That’s an earnings yield of 3.9%.

By that yardstick there would be another 7% or so downside until the average stock seems a bit cheaper than owning a government bond. Bond yields could also come down which might give some relief. 
 
Another yardstick is the average forward PE at the bottom of recent market cycles. In recessions it looks like they bottom around 12-13x forward. In 2022, we bottomed around 15x forward earnings.

valueinvesting,"Notes I recently sent to someone regarding intelligent investor:

So few things...

Times are different. In principle, yes we should really try and buy stocks at a reasonable P/E. However P/E was a primary tool for valuation back then, projecting and discounting cash flows was not as popular or really in much practice.

Few bullet points before i over explain...

- P/E is technically a predictor of future earnings growth. It is super simplified but even still, its how much I am willing to pay today under the assumption of future earnings.
- Tech/Software/etc and super high growth fields weren’t present at the time of the book. Their presence and growth trajectories inherently push up P/E mutliples as people are willing to pay more today for future growth.
- Also, back then access to information was extremely limited vs today and therefore a more inherent risk of the unknown needed to be priced into a stock, compressing P/E multiples.
- BIG BIG difference of then vs now. The reason there is so much focus on Cash Flow is because earnings are impacted by accounting stuff (Side question - how familiar are you with this concept? I do accounting so am happy to explain/help you grow understanding moving forward). Cash is straight up cash, its not debatable. Earnings have some accounting intricacies built into them.
- However, these ‘accounting intricacies’ were WAY less prevalent back then. They mainly come in the form of intangible assets and Amortization
- Back in the day, there was barely any ‘intangible assets’ like brand, coding, software, etc. Today there is. SO back then you could value a company using Book Value much better because book value more accurately actually reflected like phyiscal assets that could be liquidated and sold. Today companies are so much more than their phyiscal assets.
- Because they are so much more than their physical assets, amortization (depreciation of intangibles) appears and impacts P/E ratios majorly by depressing ‘accounting earnings’ therefore elevating PEs


- and could value much more accurately with a P/E back thenm because it more accurately reflected actual operations rather than reflecting accounting.

For reference: Back in 1975, intangible assets made up just 17% of assets on the balance sheets of S&P 500 companies.
Less than 50 years later, intangible assets exceed 90% of total assets on balance sheets. This is due to the domination of software in the economy and tech companies becoming the heaviest weighted sector in the S&P 500 by market capitalization.",note recently sent someone regarding intelligent investor thing time different principle yes really try buy stock reasonable p e however p e primary tool valuation back projecting discounting cash flow popular really much practice bullet point explain p e technically predictor future earnings growth super simplified even still much willing pay today assumption future earnings tech software etc super high growth field present time book presence growth trajectory inherently push p e mutliples people willing pay today future growth also back access information extremely limited v today therefore inherent risk unknown needed priced stock compressing p e multiple big big difference v reason much focus cash flow earnings impacted accounting stuff side question familiar concept accounting happy explain help grow understanding moving forward cash straight cash debatable earnings accounting intricacy built however accounting intricacy way le prevalent back mainly come form intangible asset amortization back day barely intangible asset like brand coding software etc today back could value company using book value much better book value accurately actually reflected like phyiscal asset could liquidated sold today company much phyiscal asset much physical asset amortization depreciation intangible appears impact p e ratio majorly depressing accounting earnings therefore elevating pe could value much accurately p e back thenm accurately reflected actual operation rather reflecting accounting reference back intangible asset made asset balance sheet p company le year later intangible asset exceed total asset balance sheet due domination software economy tech company becoming heaviest weighted sector p market capitalization,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

Well no, multiples are secularly higher than they were in Graham's day. You could adjust his ratios to fit the modern market (for example, I would say 25x earnings is about equivalent to 15x in his day), OR, you could conclude the market is overvalued, and you should only invest lightly and very selectively in it. Graham himself advocated the second approach, saying that investors should re-allocate heavily to bonds during times of ""overvaluation"", but again, things are a bit different than they were in his day, because we have a fiat monetary system and more inflation concerns with bonds.

I also watched Warren Buffet absolutely crush markets.  In 2000 he put up +27%.  2001 +6.5%.  2002 -4%.  2003 +16%.  While myself and all other retail investors got absolutely wrecked. 

I decided Buffet was right, Im just putting my spare $$ into an SP500 index fund and riding it out.  Which I did  until the great financial crisis.  At which point I put all my investments in to quality companies that were down a ton.  

I loaded up on Microsoft, Apple, Costco, Mastercard, and Home Depot.  All of which did incredibly well, but since my investing journey started at the peak of the dotcom bubble and it was now 2012… I had only averaged around 4% after 13 years of investing.  Lots of stress for minimal returns.  

However, that was when my mindset finally flipped to value investing.  Buying a quality company that is temporarily performing poorly and is all but guaranteed to rebound. 

I started buying companies that were HATED, and were performing really poorly.   But they had decades of solid performance behind them, and they were still swimming in enough cash to turn things around. 

Since 2012, Ive averaged 31% year over year by investing in turnarounds, cyclicals, and the odd large cap that temporarily tanks in price.  

Mostly cigar butts.  It’s stressful, but it’s so damn fun.  I get lots wrong, but I also found plenty of 20-40 baggers over the years.

Since the great financial crisis my returns have outperformed most years(I underperformed in 2024 tho), but since 1998 I am still below 10%.   Thankfully, I didn’t invest much in the years where I performed poorly and I invested heavily in the years where I performed well, so it feels like I have crushed.",since short answer long answer invested apple intel microsoft cisco ibm classic dumbass chasing shiny thing small amount money obsessed though also watched warren buffet absolutely crush market put retail investor got absolutely wrecked decided buffet right im putting spare sp index fund riding great financial crisis point put investment quality company ton loaded microsoft apple costco mastercard home depot incredibly well since investing journey started peak dotcom bubble averaged around year investing lot stress minimal return however mindset finally flipped value investing buying quality company temporarily performing poorly guaranteed rebound started buying company hated performing really poorly decade solid performance behind still swimming enough cash turn thing around since ive averaged year year investing turnaround cyclicals odd large cap temporarily tank price mostly cigar butt stressful damn fun get lot wrong also found plenty bagger year since great financial crisis return outperformed year underperformed tho since still thankfully invest much year performed poorly invested heavily year performed well feel like crushed,Comment,['MA'],Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,"Primarily the first but a little bit of both.

For my methodology, I require the company to be 1. undervalued by a decent margin and 2. have very consistent earnings for 10-20 years.  This helps me to avoid entering positions that are cyclical, turnaround plays, undervalued due to deteriorating fundamentals, etc.  I honestly subscribe to more of a Graham-leaning approach than Buffett/Munger/whoever.  I tend to sell at fair value whereas many other people advocate holding as long as the company is good quality.

I have sector competency in real estate, and my largest return in recent years was Realty Income and Agree Realty.  My least competent sectors are healthcare, financials (banks not BDCs), and commodity-based businesses like gold miners and oil producers/refiners.  Still, I've had great success with some names like Amgen, netting an 87% time-weighted annualized return, and I'm still holding a position in Elevance.  I'm exploring an OXY position while I'm deep-diving the oil industry right now, it's still relatively tiny, but I'm not considering that value but speculative.

\---

The reason I take to the Graham approach is that most companies that approach value levels of pricing do not have an earnings growth rate that can stand competitive with the S&P (which is my benchmark).  If I make an outsized return as it makes it's way back to my received fair value level, holding it long-term/indefinitely will make my outsized return approach the average growth that the underlying company has seen, depreciating the effort of my investment.  Sometimes, between earnings growth and dividend distributions, it can make sense to hold long-term but most often it does not.

I am less confident in my ability to project ongoing growth far into the future than I am appraising what a company is currently worth and exiting without a short to medium time-frame.

valueinvesting,"The holdings in my current 401K equivalent are limited to a predetermined offering of funds, thus I am unable to deviate.  I believe it consists of the following: S&P 500 equivalent, Russell 2000 equivalent, something similar to VXUS, SGOV, and BND, along with 5 target date funds (or something like that, I'd have to look again).

With my other tax sheltered accounts, I'm most concerned with capital preservation, as I can't contribute more to them without getting creative.  Thus, I'm just targeting slow, consistent and low volatility options for those.  With my taxable, yes I have considered it, however I have encountered a few situations which let me to just parking money there.  There are often times where I am completely uninvested in value picks, maybe because I cannot find any at that moment, or simultaneously I am ready to sell without a replacement.  In this case I have the option to either sit in cash for an indeterminate amount of time, possibly losing out on market beating returns, or having to quickly sell out of the ETF in whatever state it came to be by that time.  Since the decision-making in those scenarios becomes murky, I decided to just leave it in another target date fund to remove focus from that area.  In hindsight, I probably would have done better, but it's difficult to quantify that because I'd have to know the periods I'd have sat uninvested; I'd rather just play it safe and remove the additional work.

>How do you approach portfolio sizing for the stocks you select? Do you tend to concentrate in a few high-conviction names, or do you spread your investments across many? And have you ever had situations where a single position made up a significant portion of your portfolio, say 50% or more?

This ends up being a kind of self-regulating thing, considering that I park sold positions in the target date fund.  When that gets moved around, I'm effectively left with a zero cash balance and thus the only money I can invest is whatever I budget out of the month, plus any dividend distributions I receive.

I tend to invest in 1 to 2 names per environmental shift.  For instance, when the market was in an uproar over RFK getting picked for his role, healthcare took a dump and presented a few opportunities.  I made a move to invest in AMGN and ELV concurrently.  AMGN quickly rose to my perceived fair price, netting me a 13% return in an extremely short period of time, leading to an 86% time-weighted return.  I'm still holding ELV as I believe it still has a lot of upside.

I have had single positions make up a 50% or more.  Yes, I know that is against conventional wisdom but I think that is situational.  I actually still have one now, with 48% in TLT.  I had made a quick post about it a year and change back, and understandably I got a bit of flak for it.  Despite the price decline it's seen since that time, I'm still net positive due to distributions (and some covered calls I made), whilst hedging pretty much everything in my equity portfolio.  I'm fairly confident it will also see pretty decent upside within the next 5 years or so.

valueinvesting,"Hello everyone,

I would like to ask for your opinions on my long-term investment strategy, in particular the distribution of my PEA and CTO portfolios.
My goal is to grow my assets over 10 years or more, while remaining consistent with my investor profile.

Context :

Age: 30 years old

Profile: moderately dynamic, tolerant of volatility if justified by strong potential

Strategy: Monthly DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging), long-term horizon (10 to 20 years)

PEA: €500/month on the BNP Paribas Easy S&P 500 ETF (ESE) – objective: broad US exposure

CTO (Trade Republic): €200/month spread over 6 lines, to complement the PEA and avoid duplication with the S&P 500


Current CTO distribution:

1. ASML – 50€/month (world leader in EUV machines, industrial tech, long-term growth)


2. Intuitive Surgical – €40/month (surgical robotics, health tech)


3. Hermès – €30/month (European luxury, regular growth, defensive)


4. Equinix – €30/month (global data centers, digital infrastructures)


5. Rocket Lab – €10/month (speculative bet on space over 10 years)


6. Emerging Markets ETF – €40/month (geographic diversification outside US/Europe)



My priorities:

Avoid overexposure to GAFAM already present via my S&P 500 ETF

Have a balanced portfolio between growth, resilience, and diversification

Maintain these positions over the very long term unless there is a fundamental change


My questions:

Do you see an inconsistency in this distribution or a weakness?

In your opinion, are there any duplications, gaps or excess diversification?

Any suggestions for improvement? (change of line, reduction in the number of positions, other ETF, etc.)

Does this strategy seem relevant to you for a long-term objective of 8 to 10%/year net?


Thank you very much to those who take the time to read and respond to me,
Have a nice day everyone!

valueinvesting,"Really solid long-term setup overall. You're DCA'ing consistently, avoiding GAFAM overexposure via the S&P 500 ETF, and you've clearly thought about balancing growth with resilience and diversification. Respect.

A few quick thoughts:

* **ASML, Intuitive, and Equinix** are great long-term compounders with strong moats. No issues there.
* **Hermès** is a nice defensive play, though it does overlap with general European luxury exposure (which might be indirectly included in your EM ETF depending on the provider).
* **Rocket Lab** at €10/month is fine as a moonshot, but I’d just keep expectations low unless they hit major milestones. Might even swap it for a small position in something with asymmetric upside *and* stronger fundamentals.
* **EM ETF** is smart for geographic diversification, but check what's actually inside—it’s often heavy in China and state-owned enterprises. If you want true diversification, some actively managed global picks can outperform here.

I’ve been focusing more on asymmetric global plays lately—stuff with strong fundamentals but under-the-radar pricing.

valueinvesting,"Thank you for your reasoned feedback!
Indeed, I agree that DCA on very expensive stocks should be handled with caution, especially if future growth disappoints.
In my case, I do not use Hermès as a performance pillar, but rather as a resilient and qualitative line which:

Provides sectoral diversification (luxury) absent from the S&P 500,

Has a history of very solid, non-cyclical earnings growth,

And remains less correlated to the US tech stocks that I already hold via ETF.


I view Hermès as a long-term (10-20 years) buy and hold position, not a dividend line.
The goal is to complete an ETF base (S&P 500 on PEA + Emergents on CTO) with sustainable growth companies.

That said, your point on valuations is very relevant, and I will remain attentive to this in my future reinforcements.",thank reasoned feedback indeed agree dca expensive stock handled caution especially future growth disappoints case use herm performance pillar rather resilient qualitative line provides sectoral diversification luxury absent p history solid non cyclical earnings growth remains le correlated u tech stock already hold via etf view herm long term year buy hold position dividend line goal complete etf base p pea emergents cto sustainable growth company said point valuation relevant remain attentive future reinforcement,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
valueinvesting,"Thank you for your analysis!
It's true that Hermès' current PER (~45) may seem absurd for a classic value investor, and I understand your reasoning perfectly: buying a company at a high price requires being very confident in its ability to maintain exceptional growth.

That said, I rather place myself in a very long-term (10–20 years) “quality-compounding” perspective, like Terry Smith or Pat Dorsey:

Here is what motivates my choice to include Hermès in my long-term portfolio:

EPS growth: as you point out, Hermès posted annualized EPS growth of +18.6% over 10 years. Even with a slowdown to +10–12%, this remains well above inflation and most defensive stocks.

Exceptional price: Hermès is one of the rare businesses in the world to be able to increase its prices without impacting its demand, thanks to unique brand power, organized scarcity and an ultra-solvent clientele.

Economic resilience: during the Covid crisis or 2008, Hermès outperformed the luxury sector and the overall market. A recession would perhaps affect its growth, but not its solidity.

Disciplined capital allocation: very little debt, internal R&D, prudent distribution, and consistent long-term strategy. It is a “family” company in its vision, not opportunistic.

I am not looking for an immediate profit return, but a patient accumulation of value and strength over several economic cycles.



---

> Yes, Hermès is expensive. But it's still expensive. And yet, its long-term performance is superior to most cyclical stocks with a reasonable PER.



I am not betting on a multiple that soars, I am betting on regular and qualitative growth in a sector that is poorly represented in my portfolio (I am already exposed to the S&P 500 at €500/month, so already a lot of tech and companies with a moderate PER).

But I appreciate your point of view, because it pushes me to think about the unfavorable scenario: if Hermès slows down below 8–9%/year, its PER will have to normalize… and there, yes, the performance could be disappointing.

I keep that in mind, and I may reduce its weight if the macro context hardens significantly.",thank analysis true herm current per may seem absurd classic value investor understand reasoning perfectly buying company high price requires confident ability maintain exceptional growth said rather place long term year quality compounding perspective like terry smith pat dorsey motivates choice include herm long term portfolio eps growth point herm posted annualized eps growth year even slowdown remains well inflation defensive stock exceptional price herm one rare business world able increase price without impacting demand thanks unique brand power organized scarcity ultra solvent clientele economic resilience covid crisis herm outperformed luxury sector overall market recession would perhaps affect growth solidity disciplined capital allocation little debt internal r prudent distribution consistent long term strategy family company vision opportunistic looking immediate profit return patient accumulation value strength several economic cycle yes herm expensive still expensive yet long term performance superior cyclical stock reasonable per betting multiple soar betting regular qualitative growth sector poorly represented portfolio already exposed p month already lot tech company moderate per appreciate point view push think unfavorable scenario herm slows year per normalize yes performance could disappointing keep mind may reduce weight macro context hardens significantly,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
valueinvesting,"Totally agree—paralysis by analysis wrecks more portfolios than bad stock picks. Some of the best returns I’ve had came from buying when things *felt* terrible but the math still made sense. The people who wait for everything to feel “safe” usually end up buying at the top.

valueinvesting,"Glad to know you enjoyed the post :)

Unfortunately I don't think there are any free screeners that can do that. Bloomberg terminal can do it, but of course, it costs a lot of money. An alternative is to use excel. But in general though, for more complex queries I like [this screener](https://beyondspx.com/screener) because of how versatile it is. 

You just have to type something in, and then it converts the text into an actual screening query and shows you the results. For example, you could type ""Healthcare stocks where P/E over Debt-to-Equity is below 15"" and it would give you companies that fit that criteria. Unfortunately it is still rather limited for historical comparisons (like queries that require historical data) but it is still quite helpful IMO. Another benefit of its design is that it's text based (you type what you want to filter by), so you don't have to manually navigate the UI for the thousands of metrics it has access to.

An additional option, if you're in university, is to use FactSet, S&P Capital IQ, or Morningstar. They are paid but universities often have free subscriptions for students.",glad know enjoyed post unfortunately think free screener bloomberg terminal course cost lot money alternative use excel general though complex query like screener http beyondspx com screener versatile type something convert text actual screening query show result example could type healthcare stock p e debt equity would give company fit criterion unfortunately still rather limited historical comparison like query require historical data still quite helpful imo another benefit design text based type want filter manually navigate ui thousand metric access additional option university use factset p capital iq morningstar paid university often free subscription student,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,What is the average P/E or EV/EBITDA of your Portfolio versus the S&P 500 ? How do you rationalise it as a value investor ?,average p e ev ebitda portfolio versus p rationalise value investor,Title,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
valueinvesting,"(I have updated the article with the definition of Normalized P/E below)

**What is the average P/E or EV/EBITDA of your Portfolio versus the S&P 500 ?**

How do you rationalise it as a vaue investor ?

Here is mine:

============================================

I calculated the P/E ratio and EV/EBITDA of the individual stocks and gave it a value in proportion to its size in the portfolio. Here are the results:

|Raytoei|P/E Normalised|P/E|EV/EBITDA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|||||
|Portfolio A|35.40|28.49|19.70|
|The S&P 500|28.77|28.77|24.4|

The top 3 Cheapest by Earnings Yield are:

    P/E Normalised  Pfizer Ulta Beauty Sysco
    PE (GAAP)        BRK.B   Ulta Beauty Hershey

`EV/EBITDA: Pfizer , Ulta Beauty and BRK.B `

\* I believe Berkshire should be better valued by Book Value rather than earnings or EBITDA, the fact that WEB did not buy back shares last quarter is perhaps because the shares are not cheap.

(These tables were done at the beginning of the week )

**Observation**:

(1) . Since my portfolio consists of a basket of stocks across many industries, comparing it against the S&P 500 is reasonable. (i organise my portfolio according to growth speeds)

(2). From a EV/EBITDA perspective, my stocks aren't so expensive but the P/E Ratio and the Normalized P/E ratios show that my stocks arent cheap either, i would say they are expensive.

**Rationalization**:

(3). In my defence, i did not buy the stocks dear, instead i bought them quite cheap and i held on to it.

It has gotten expensive as it grew and appreciated in value.

Most value investors would seriously consider selling the stocks when they are fully or over valued.

I am not selling the stock as long as (a) the quality hasn't deteriorated (b) Demand for the company's wares are still intact.

Case in point in GE Aerospace, it's ratios are high and it is considered ""expensive"",

P/E normalized 46.82

P/E Ratio 34.52

EV/EBITDA 25.52

I bought it a long time ago, and it has appreciated in value. Should i have sold it ? I asked myself that question last year after it appreciated 60+%. I came to the conclusion no, a great wonderful business such as GE comes rarely cheap, and I should let it run, instead of ""cutting the flowers and watering the weeds"".

The business is also in high demand, and operates as a oligopoly where there are only 3 engine suppliers and GE is the largest player. So i left it in the portfolio, even at the risk of [concentration](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ippfo9/portfolio_ab_feb_15_2025/).

================================================================

(**Disclosure**: i am a buy and hold investor of high quality stocks and i dont overpay for them. I buy based on growth speeds: a. Recognized Growth, b. Unrecognized Growth c. Moderate Growth and Turnarounds. i publish my portfolio every saturday on my reddit page).


==========================     
**What is normalised p/e ?** 

It is P/E ratio based on normalized earnings.

Normalized earnings, also known as Adjusted Earnings, are NON-GAAP earnings that removes one-time charges that is deemed as not part of the normal business. For example, the company decides to close a division, and has to pay severance fees, this is an expense that is considered non-recurring. Or the company decides to dispose of some assets that requires removal fees, since this is not part of the business it should be excluded. 

In the past, analysts would do the adjustments manually, to produce a normalized EPS. These days, the adjusted EPS are sometimes provided by the company. Also, many data websites provide the normalized earnings as well. However Normalized P/E ratio is quite rare and is still manually done by hand. 

Please note that normalised earnings can be abused, it can be whatever the company say it is, just like earnings. What i try to do is to use several sources and see how much variance there are when it comes to normalized earnings. 

For example, let's look at Pfizer. 

In https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/    the P/E ratio is 17.74 and the EPS (trailing twelve months, which in this case refers to 2024 EPS ) is 1.41

however, if you go to ""Analysis"" on the side, https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/analysis/ 

Look at year ago EPS (refers to 2024) , it says 3.11 

This 3.11 is normalized EPS, so if you calculate the normalized P/E, it is $25 / 3.11 = 8.03. 

So the normalized P/E of Pfizer is 8.03. 

This is consistent with morningstar data 
here: https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/pfe/key-metrics

Diluted EPS 1.41

Normalized EPS 3.11

valueinvesting,"the flipside of this is that stagflation, even in the face of potential tariffs, is exceedingly unlikely. the only real stagflationary periods we've had were driven primarily by prolonged supply shocks: think things like forced oil shortages via OPEC, or the global supply chain slowing to a crawl during COVID. tariffs and structural reshoring might drive inflation structurally higher than, say, the 2010s, but it's hard to see inflation persistently above 4% without some major negative supply shock.

also, to say the market is being propped up by grifters is disingenuous. the market is being propped up by the largest and most productive workforce the US has ever seen, incredible amounts of FCF, earnings, and revenues being generated by the strongest companies on the planet, and record profit margins that show no real signs of slowing down. just because we have an uptick in shitcoins and Trump is tweeting about $TRUMP doesn't really change the magnitude and dynamism of the US economy.

now look, i do agree that the US labor market isn't as healthy as the narrative currently has it, and we are likely to see a meaningful slowdown in growth, from 2.5% to maybe mid 1% this year, due to tariffs, uncertainty, etc. and when your margins are tight like that, it's not unreasonable to see a slip down into negative growth for a few quarters and a labor market that deteriorates further. but to act like this is some certain outcome is foolish. most analysts thought we were going to see a recession in 2023 and 2024 for similar reasons, it didn't play out, the market was up 50% over that two year time.

so my point is that while the market could go down from here, to act like it's some certain outcome is nothing short of hubris. if you want to continue down this path, i highly encourage you to track your opinions and buy/sell decisions (ideally with a real portfolio!) and compare that to simply holding the MSCI ACWI or S&P 500 or whatever benchmark  you think is best. if you're younger, you'll start to see how consistently wrong you are (or maybe you're a savant and can go work at a hedge fund!).  if you're older, i encourage you to only do this with 10% of your portfolio so you don't completely fuck yourself, and see how the other 90% (which is hopefully just always invested in the broad market) outperforms your 10% sleeve over a 5-10 year period.

I recommend this book as an introduction to value investing. The 2nd edition is a better book, in my opinion as it has the Chapter 7 on when to sell (I posted in the subreddit 2 weeks ago) . My own 3rd edition omitted this chapter and talked about corporate governance. 

*Please note the flair: Basics / Getting started*

=================

**CHAPTER 4**

**The Filtering Process**  

Several methods were presented in Chapter 3 that allow value investors to distinguish between ""good"" and ""bad"" companies. That's a good start, but further refinement is still necessary. For example, even some ""good"" companies might be too risky for most investors.

This chapter will present guidelines that can be used as tools to analyze and eliminate ""too-risky"" companies. Also included are five tests that value investors can use to determine an investment's intrinsic value and its margin of safety. Screening shortcuts that stick closely to Benjamin Graham's beliefs are also presented.

Let's begin the filtering process by screening for risk. Eliminate a company if any of the following criteria applies:

1. Losses were sustained within the past five years.
2. Total debt is greater than 100 percent of total tangible equity.
3. Share price is above book value.
4. Earnings yield is less than twice current long-term (20-year) AAA bond yields. \[A company's earnings yield is its price earnings ratio turned inside out. For example, if a stock is selling for $30 per share with earnings of $2 per share, its price-earnings (P/E) ratio is 15 ($30 / $2 = 15). To get the earnings yield, divide the P/E ratio by 1.0. In this case, the earnings yield would be 6.6% (1 / 15 = 0.066, or 6.6%)\].

Admittedly, these guidelines are strict. Is there room for exceptions? Yes, but be careful not to rationalize yourself into taking on too much risk. The experienced value investor might possibly ignore one or more of the criteria, but only if compelling and well-researched reasons exist

for doing so. For example, the second criterion might be overlooked if a company's debt has a low interest rate, or if a company's earnings are especially strong and stable.

Or, number three could be ignored, provided the company has sustained high rates of return on book value. If that analysis proves too tricky, however, it may be safer to follow the precise guidelines.

**FIVE TESTS FOR VALUE**

Eliminating high-risk companies will shrink the value list some; filtering for value will reduce it even more. 

Graham listed five tests for value and five for safety. He did so not for professors and academicians, but to rescue average investors who had become swamped by Wall Street's blather.

Stocks were true bargains, he believed, if they met only one of the value criteria listed below plus only one of the safety criteria.

**The five tests for value are:**

1. The earnings yield should be at least twice the AAA bond yield. (The careful reader will note we've already eliminated companies not meeting this criterion.)
2. The stock's price/earnings ratio should fall among the lowest 10 percent of the equity universe.

3. The stock's dividend yield should be at least two-thirds of the long-term AAA bond yield.

4. The stock's price should be no more than two-thirds of the company's tangible book value per share.

5. The company should be selling in the market for no more than two-thirds of its net current assets.

**The five tests for safety are as follows:**

1. A company should owe no more than it's worth, i.e., total debt should not exceed book value. (In accounting terms, the company's debt/equity ratio should be less than 1.0.)
2. Current assets should be at least twice current liabilities.
3. Total debt should be less than twice net current assets.
4. Earnings growth should have been at least 7 percent per annum compounded over the previous decade.
5. As an indication of earnings stability, there should have been no more than two annual earnings declines of 5 percent or more during the previous decade.

**MARGIN OF SAFETY**

One common theme that recurs throughout Graham's work is the importance of creating a margin of safety. Although the future is unpredictable, we do know that nearly every business eventually encounters the proverbial rainy day.

When stormy weather hits, the value investor wants protection.

Purchasing a stock at a low enough price provides a certain degree of protection, even if a company later has problems. That's because a company's assets or long-term earning power remains far above the firm's actual market valuation.

For example, let's say investors bought stock in Company A at 50 percent of fair value and afterwards Company A fell on hard times. Since the investors' purchase price was so low, they still might come out with at least their initial investment, even though Company A's value subsequently dropped.

But suppose that Company B's stock was purchased at 40 times earnings and five times book value per share. At those valuation levels, any amount of bad news about the company would make it difficult or impossible for investors to recoup their losses over any reasonable period.

Building in a margin of safety through a favorable purchase price provides an important hedge that takes miscalculations-or bad luck-into account. Think of it like going to the beach for a picnic. Before you put down your basket, you check to see how far the waves are running onto

the shore. But you don't just settle on a spot six inches back from the waterline-that's too close for comfort. You put your basket down well away from the waterline. That added

distance is your margin of safety for those few times when you know Mother Nature will act out of the ordinary.

**Shortcuts Speed Things Up**

Human beings are constantly striving to find shortcuts. It doesn't matter whether it's a new route for driving to the store, or a faster procedure for doing your taxes, ways are

constantly being devised to do it quicker and better.

That same principle holds true in value investing. The prudent investor could benefit from two shortcuts; both save considerable time and energy. The first deals with price-earnings (P/E) multiples. The second shortcut takes into account a company's net-net value.

**Track P/E Multiples**

Tracking P/E ratios works superbly, at least for a quick initial screen. Simply scour any of the sources listed in Chapter 3 to find companies whose P/E multiple is less than half that of the overall market.

Remember from our earlier tests for safety that a company's price-earnings ratio, or P/E, is the relationship between its stock price and its earnings. A company selling for $40 per share with $2 per share of earnings would have a P/E ratio of 20 ($40 / $2 = 20).

Next, determine the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 Index. In this case, we're using the popular benchmark as a proxy for the entire U.S. equities market. Again, most of the financial sources listed in Chapter 3 provide this information.

For purposes of our example, let's suppose the P/E of the S&P 500 is 14, which also happens to be its long-term average. In that case, you would hunt for companies selling at less than seven times earnings.

Any stock that meets that criterion qualifies as a potential bargain. The more a company earns relative to its stock price, the lower its P/E. It follows then, that the lower a company's P/E relative to the overall market, the better the bargain. Comparing P/E ratios of similar stocks also helps determine the best buy.

(Over the last 50 years, the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 has ranged from a low of roughly 8 times earnings to a high of about 24 times earnings. Inflation is the primary factor influencing the market's overall valuation. When inflation is high, interest rates also tend to be high. That, in turn, makes yields on competing asset classes such as bonds and cash equivalents more attractive, diverting money away from stocks and depressing valuations. When inflation soared to 13 percent in 1974, for example, the market's P/E ratio fell to just eight times earnings. Conversely, low or falling inflation pushes cash and bond yields lower, usually leading to elevated equity-market multiples.)

**The Net-Net Method**

Graham's most famous theory was that investors should buy stocks at prices of no more than two-thirds of the company's current assets (cash and equivalents on hand, including immediately salable inventory), minus all liabilities (including off-balance-sheet liabilities such as capital leases or unfunded pension liabilities). Nothing was paid for permanent assets such as property, plant, and equipment, or intangible assets such as goodwill.

Graham held that if a company traded at two-thirds of this amount-known as net-net current assets-and was profitable, then investors needed no other yardstick.

""What about companies that qualified except for current losses?"" I asked Graham. Those companies, he believed, were dangerously situated. Losses constantly burn up corporate assets and could incinerate the appropriate margin of safety.

Today, elevated valuations in the United States equity market make it nearly impossible to find a profitable company selling at a one-third discount to its net-net current assets. However, using the databases listed in Chapter 3, value investors can screen for those companies with the lowest net-net asset ratios.

**GRAHAM'S SECOND BEST-KNOWN METHOD**

Graham's other dictum, slightly more complicated, involved three linked parts: earnings yield, dividend yield, and bal- ance sheet debt.

**Earnings Yield**

Bargain stocks, he believed, required earnings yields of more than twice the yield on AAA long-term bonds. (Yield is just another way of saying ""rate of return on your investment."") You'll remember from our earlier example that a company's earnings yield is its price-earnings ratio expressed as a percentage of its stock price. To find a company's earnings yield, simply divide 1 by its P/E. If Company A sells for 10 times earnings, it would have an earnings yield of 10 percent (1 / 10 = 0.10, or 10 percent).

\[Caution: Don't confuse earnings yield with dividend yield. Both types of yields are expressed as a percentage of the market price, but the dividend yield is the amount actually paid shareholders.\]

Now suppose AAA bonds yield 8 percent. Under those circumstances, a bargain stock would be one with an earnings yield of 16 percent or better. (An earnings yield of 16 corresponds to a P/E ratio of 6.25.)

Or suppose AAA bonds currently yield 7 percent. Then, for the stock to be an appropriate value stock, the earnings yield would need to be 14 percent-the same as seven times earnings.

**Dividend Yield**

Dividend yield was the next segment of Graham's three-part criteria. Dividend yields, he said, must be no less than two-thirds of the current AAA bond yield. In other words, when long-term AAA bonds yield 9 percent, the value investor looks for stocks with dividend yields of no less than 6 percent.

**Balance Sheet Debt**

Balance sheet debt was Graham's final leg. His general rule regarding debt was that companies should owe no more than they are worth.

Graham reasoned that debt was a major negative factor because it created heavy interest expense that could easily drain a company's assets. Investing in debt-burdened companies means gambling that future earnings will be high enough to meet debt service. Better to scout out companies with small debts.

**How Small Is a Small Debt Load?**

How small is small? Look for debt payments that are no more than one-third of a company's earnings at their cyclical low. That's a good rule of thumb, although it isn't hard and fast.

What might be considered a healthy debt ratio depends on the nature of the company and its business.

For example, equipment leasing companies live and die by debt financing. Chances are good that such companies will carry more debt than oil exploration and development firms. Financial companies such as banks use borrowed funds that, in the main, originate from customers' savings

and checking accounts. Their profit comes from the spread-the difference between the cost of the borrowed money and what can be achieved with it. Solidly financed banks may have only 6 percent of total assets in equity and the rest mainly borrowed. Surprisingly, that could be considered a

safe balance sheet. In general, utilities pile up more obligations than industrial companies, since they're guaranteed a certain return.

Now let's begin the really fine tuning. The focus will be narrowed still more in Chapter 5.",hi including chapter charles brandes book value investing today chapter stock selection criterion benjamin graham taught want page better

I’ve seen some posts in the sub really bashing services like Zack’s as bullshit - I have to wholeheartedly disagree.

I’ve used their service for about 3 months now - trying to find companies in attractive sectors with good value and growth metrics. 

My total portfolio is up about 13% YTD while the S&P is down almost 2% YTD. Just utilizing some analysis & common sense on my part and letting Zack’s do all the legwork. They’ve paid for their yearly subscription 3x over already.

While all of them run essential infrastructure, not all exchanges are created equal. Some are near-monopolies with durable moats. Others are increasingly exposed to tech disruption and regulatory risk.

**Key takeaways:**

• **CME** is a global fortress in futures and clearing. Its products (e.g., S&P 500 futures, Eurodollars) are irreplaceable. It owns the clearinghouse and collects tolls at every step.

• **ICE** is an empire spanning commodities, fixed income, data, and even mortgage tech. Its diversification and vertical integration give it rare pricing power.

• **Nasdaq** has strong brands and recurring revenue from indices and SaaS—but its core trading business is being chipped away by ATSs and ECNs. It’s the most exposed to structural change.

• **Cboe** is a specialist in options and volatility (VIX), but it lacks the scale, clearing infrastructure, and recurring revenue of its peers.

Hello everyone,

I’ve been eyeing Blue Bird (BLBD) at $33. It’s a school bus maker I’ve spotted everywhere. Looks like a simple, growing, under-the-radar business. Buy or skip? Here’s the scoop:

- Simple Business: Makes school buses (diesel and electric). No tech jargon. Just transports kids. I get it in one sentence.

- Growth: 2024 revenue $1.35B (up 19%), EPS $3.23 (up 112% so doubled!), 7,500-unit backlog. 2025 guidance: $1.45-$1.55B, 20%+ EPS growth ($4+). Fast-grower vibes.

- Valuation: P/E 14 (trailing), 11-12 (forward $4 EPS), PEG 0.6 (very cheap) vs. 20% growth. S&P’s at 25.

- Financial Health: $129M cash, $94M net debt (0.7x EBITDA), $131M free cash flow. Lean, funds expansion. No red flags.

- Moat: ~50% U.S. bus share, so schools trust them for decades. Diesel’s steady; EVs (700+ sold) add edge.

- Customer Base: Schools nationwide. Must hav not discretionary. ~25,000-33,000 buses replaced yearly, so rock-solid demand.

- Catalysts: EV shift (1,000 backlog), capacity up (12,000 to 14,000+ units), growing margins (19.1% vs. 12.2% in 2023). Multi-year runway.

- Market Perception: $1.5B cap, sparse coverage with Wall Street’s asleep.

- Insider Buying No big moves in 2024 filings—neutral. Management’s steady, not dumping. They announced a large share buyback program in February of this year. 

- Inventory/Backlog: 7,500 firm orders ($675M+)—6+ months locked. No pile-up, just demand.

- Risks: Competition (Lion Electric, IC Bus) could bite; EV scaling’s tricky, supply snags possible. Growth’s not bulletproof.

- Upside: EPS $8 by 2028 (backlog + EVs), P/E 20 = $160, so 3x-5x bagger shot. Even $6 EPS, P/E 15 = $90, so almost triple the current price.

Feels like a great buy since it’s so simple, growing, cheap, with a moat and upside. Risks exist, but buses aren’t going away. Anyone holding? Buy at $33, or am I overhyping? Value nerds hit me with your takes!

valueinvesting,"Guilty! At least for the structure, less so for the analysis :D 

From their most recent quarterly report, it's likely because of their dip in net sales (-14% from 4900M yen to 4178M in Q1) and increase in operating costs due to reinvestment to new services (e.g. establishing a consulting business as a growth accelerator) and growing their sales and advisory team to accelerate the closure of existing deals faster.

valueinvesting,"You need to understand the why MS is pulling back. There is a ton of extenuating factors to support data center infrastructure.AI requires a lot of power and that was one of the reasons. Gov't potential taxes, the lack of power grid support at certain data center site builds etc.

I don't believe generative AI is a huge bubble. Is it overhyped yes by the media and general public understanding. There are challenges and will be speed bumps. This is typical of FOMO with new technology. 

Understanding the why is important. Companies don't want to be left beyond or at a disadvantage to competitors. They will run pilots and POC of new tech to try and determine ROI etc. 

AI has challenges with one being at the business level in change management. Others are data governance, privacy, regulation, bias, clean data, etc.

What I can say is isn't going away and it will have profound impacts on business and companies.

This comes from having sold enterprise software in the space and having a fair understanding of the tech ecosystem.

AI is a tool that will reshape many businesses functions. It will require employees to reskill and potentially reduce headcount in companies and departments. Think assistant where a human expert validates output. That is short term and long term will be very interesting.

I am not saying Coreweave is something I would touch. That is a good article, I read between the lines a little. One the markets are irrational in many ways.

valueinvesting,"Hey everyone,

I'm working on building a value-oriented portfolio using dollar-cost averaging (**DCA**) for this upcoming month. I recently ran a DCF analysis for several stocks and determined an intrinsic value per share. Based on the discount (i.e., the difference between the intrinsic value and the current market price after also adjusting for S&P rating), I allocated a “**Weight %**” for each stock to decide what percentage of my total capital should be invested in each position. Here's a snapshot of my data:

|**Stock Symbol**|**Discount %**|**Weight %**|**Stock Price**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|GOOGL|17%|14%|$164|
|MSFT|15%|12%|$391|
|ADBE|13%|11%|$387|
|NVDA|12%|10%|$118|
|QCOM|30%|24%|$157|
|PEP|23%|18%|$145|
|AMD|13%|11%|$106|
|AVGO|14%|11%|$192|
|DIS|19%|16%|$99|

I'm a bit confused on a couple of points and would really appreciate your suggestions or critiques, especially from fellow value investors. Here’s my qualitative take on each stock, based on traditional value investing parameters (Buffett, Pabrai, etc.):

   * Faces integration and regulatory risks related to its acquisitions.

**DIS (Walt Disney Co.)**

* **Pros:**
   * Iconic brand with a vast content library and a strong media empire that has long-term value.
   * The current discount (19%) makes it attractive if the turnaround in its streaming and content strategy succeeds.
* **Cons:**
   * Experiencing margin compression and operational challenges during its turnaround phase.
   * Highly competitive streaming environment creates uncertainty regarding future profitability.

**Questions for the Community:**

* Do the weightings based on the DCF discount percentages align well with each company’s qualitative strengths and risks?
* Are there any additional qualitative factors or red flags I should consider for these stocks?
* Would you adjust the allocations or exclude any positions based on your own value investing criteria?

I appreciate any feedback, no-sarcastic comment, suggestions, or alternative approaches you might have!

valueinvesting,"Thanks for your thoughtful feedback! I can’t share the full model code since it’s heavily customized to my personal strategy, but here’s an overview of my approach and key formulas:

**1. DCF Valuation & FCFF Forecasting**

* **FCFF Calculation:** I calculate Free Cash Flow to the Firm as: **FCFF = Operating Cash Flow – Capital Expenditures**
* **Forecasting FCFF (Base Case):** I project FCFF over five years using a 5-year CAGR: **Forecast FCFF = Base Year FCFF × (1 + Growth Rate)\^5** When growth shifts from negative to positive, I use a custom method (the Fort Marinus method) that overcomes issues with standard geometric mean formulas.

**2. Cost of Equity & WACC**

* **Cost of Equity:** Instead of CAPM (with beta and risk-free rate), I use Bruce Greenwald’s method: **CoE = After-Tax Cost of Debt + Final Risk Premium**
* **WACC Calculation:** I compute WACC as: **WACC = (Equity/(Equity+Debt)) × CoE + (Debt/(Equity+Debt)) × Cost of Debt × (1 – Tax Rate)** My model currently calculates a WACC of about 9.96%.

**3. Cost of Debt**

* **Cost of Debt Calculation:** I derive it by dividing Interest Expense by Total Debt: **Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt** This comes out around.

**4. CAGR Calculation**

* **Standard CAGR Formula:** Normally, CAGR = (Ending Value/Beginning Value)\^(1/Years) – 1.
* **Custom Adjustment:** For negative-to-positive transitions, I adjust the formula to: **CAGR = ((Final Value – Initial Value + |Initial Value|)/|Initial Value|)\^(1/5) – 1** This helps avoid distortions from traditional methods.

**5. Intrinsic Value & Margin of Safety**

* **Intrinsic Value Calculation:** I discount future FCFF (including a terminal value) using WACC, then adjust for net debt and shares outstanding to get intrinsic value per share.
* **Margin of Safety (MoS):** I factor in S&P credit ratings to set the MoS—AAA-rated stocks might only need a 5% discount, while lower-rated ones (e.g., BB or B-) require a higher discount before I consider them undervalued.",thanks thoughtful feedback share full model code since heavily customized personal strategy overview approach key formula dcf valuation fcff forecasting fcff calculation calculate free cash flow firm fcff operating cash flow capital expenditure forecasting fcff base case project fcff five year using year cagr forecast fcff base year fcff growth rate growth shift negative positive use custom method fort marinus method overcomes issue standard geometric mean formula cost equity wacc cost equity instead capm beta risk free rate use bruce greenwald method coe tax cost debt final risk premium wacc calculation compute wacc wacc equity equity debt coe debt equity debt cost debt tax rate model currently calculates wacc cost debt cost debt calculation derive dividing interest expense total debt cost debt interest expense total debt come around cagr calculation standard cagr formula normally cagr ending value beginning value year custom adjustment negative positive transition adjust formula cagr final value initial value initial value initial value help avoid distortion traditional method intrinsic value margin safety intrinsic value calculation discount future fcff including terminal value using wacc adjust net debt share outstanding get intrinsic value per share margin safety mo factor p credit rating set mo aaa rated stock might need discount lower rated one e g bb b require higher discount consider undervalued,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,"Maybe the difference is this:

a typical Market Timer says ""now the bear market has started, so i wait till the Index is 35% down from the top"", assuming, this is the low.

Value Investing say: ""IF the stock is below 22, then it is cheap compared to the earnings and equity"".

So, the point for me is:
A usal Market-Timer says, he knows, how deep the market or stock will fall.
The Value Investor doesn't know it.

A Value Investor would say: ""The S&P 500 is overvalued. It fair value may be around 2'500 points. But i don't know, if and when it goes so deep.""

A Market-Timer would say:
""The S&P is in a bear market and will fall more. By the end of year it is below 2'500 Points, so i can buy then, because it will not go andy deeper.""

The Value Investor only know the fair value.
But he does not know, how deep the stock will fall.

The Market Timer believes, he can know exactly if the lowest point is reached now and if it goes up or down the next 3 months.

What is your opinion?
What is the risk?

Here is what chatgpt AI thinks:

Is there a conflict of interest for large asset managers that operate both passive index ETFs and actively managed ETFs regarding Tesla?

Answer:

Yes, there are potential conflicts of interest for major asset managers like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, which manage both passive index ETFs and actively managed ETFs and funds. These conflicts are particularly relevant for a stock like Tesla, which is included in many passive indices but is also attractive for active strategies.

Potential Conflicts of Interest:
	1.	Passive Holding vs. Active Trading
	•	Index ETFs must hold Tesla as long as it remains in the index, regardless of valuation or fundamentals.
	•	Actively managed funds, on the other hand, can freely buy or sell Tesla based on their investment strategy.
	•	Conflict: A firm could reduce Tesla in an active fund or short-sell it while still holding large amounts in passive ETFs.
	2.	Impact of Index Changes on Stock Price
	•	If Tesla is removed from a major index (e.g., S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100), passive ETFs must sell their Tesla shares, which could put downward pressure on the stock.
	•	At the same time, actively managed funds from the same firm could capitalize on this decline by shorting the stock or buying at lower prices.
	•	Conflict: Large asset managers could potentially exploit these market flows for their active strategies.
	3.	Voting Rights and Corporate Policy
	•	Large index funds like those managed by Vanguard or BlackRock own millions of Tesla shares and thus hold significant voting power at shareholder meetings.
	•	Meanwhile, active funds from the same firms may advocate for different corporate strategies.
	•	Conflict: The same firm could support Elon Musk’s leadership through its passive ETFs while opposing it via its active funds.
	4.	Internal Arbitrage Opportunities
	•	Large asset managers have insight into both passive and active fund flows.
	•	They could anticipate when passive ETFs need to sell Tesla shares and use this knowledge for active strategies, such as short selling or buying at a discount.
	•	Conflict: If such strategies are deliberately used, they could create an unfair market advantage.

Conclusion:

Yes, there are potential conflicts of interest between passive and active funds within major asset management firms, especially for heavily weighted stocks like Tesla. The concern is that these firms could leverage market dynamics for their own benefit—whether through trading strategies, voting power, or timing of index adjustments. Regulators like the SEC monitor such practices, but there are currently few strict restrictions in place.",tsla held large asset manager like vanguard blackrock opinion risk chatgpt ai think conflict interest large asset manager operate passive index etf actively managed etf regarding tesla answer yes potential conflict interest major asset manager like blackrock vanguard state street manage passive index etf actively managed etf fund conflict particularly relevant stock like tesla included many passive index also attractive active strategy potential conflict interest passive holding v active trading index etf must hold tesla long remains index regardless valuation fundamental actively managed fund hand freely buy sell tesla based investment strategy conflict firm could reduce tesla active fund short sell still holding large amount passive etf impact index change stock price tesla removed major index e g p nasdaq passive etf must sell tesla share could put downward pressure stock time actively managed fund firm could capitalize decline shorting stock buying lower price conflict large asset manager could potentially exploit market flow active strategy voting right corporate policy large index fund like managed vanguard blackrock million tesla share thus hold significant voting power shareholder meeting meanwhile active fund firm may advocate different corporate strategy conflict firm could support elon musk leadership passive etf opposing via active fund internal arbitrage opportunity large asset manager insight passive active fund flow could anticipate passive etf need sell tesla share use knowledge active strategy short selling buying discount conflict strategy deliberately used could create unfair market advantage conclusion yes potential conflict interest passive active fund within major asset management firm especially heavily weighted stock like tesla concern firm could leverage market dynamic benefit whether trading strategy voting power timing index adjustment regulator like sec monitor practice currently strict restriction place,Body,"['SPGI', 'BLK']",Banks & Finance
valueinvesting,"S&P Capital IQ, although I do have BBG access too. 

Honestly though, unless it’s a distressed company, it’s really not that important to consider market value of debt. Won’t be a huge difference.

The idea that the market value of debt more accurately reflects the market views on the true value of recovery is more so applicable to distressed opportunities. In most cases, for performing companies, fluctuations in the value of the bonds have more to do with a shifting rates environment, with the market still expecting par recovery, as opposed to a fundamental bearish view on the enterprise value of the business (and consequently recoveries). So using market value of debt doesn’t matter as much for performing companies when doing your EV calculations despite varying bond valuations.",p capital iq although bbg access honestly though unless distressed company really important consider market value debt huge difference idea market value debt accurately reflects market view true value recovery applicable distressed opportunity case performing company fluctuation value bond shifting rate environment market still expecting par recovery opposed fundamental bearish view enterprise value business consequently recovery using market value debt matter much performing company ev calculation despite varying bond valuation,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,"Robinhood (HOOD) is evolving beyond a simple trading app into a full-fledged fintech platform. With revenue streams spanning trading fees, interest income, and subscriptions, the company has built a diversified and scalable business model. The latest earnings report showed record profits and revenue, higher interest income, and strong user engagement. Despite the stock’s recent rally, Robinhood’s long-term growth potential remains under-appreciated.

Robinhood popularized commission-free trading, making it easy for anyone to invest in stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. But it has since expanded into retirement accounts, cash management, and a premium subscription service. The company now generates revenue from three primary sources: trading fees through payment for order flow (PFOF), interest on customer cash and margin lending, and subscriptions via Robinhood Gold. This multi-revenue approach reduces reliance on volatile trading activity and creates a more predictable financial model.

It's biggest strength is its brand and user experience. It remains the go-to investing app for Millennials and Gen Z, offering a sleek, easy-to-use platform. Its large user base gives it leverage in pricing deals with market makers. And with product expansions into retirement investing, crypto wallets, and a Gold credit card, Robinhood is making its ecosystem even stickier. But competition is fierce. Rivals like Schwab, Fidelity, and Webull offer similar services, and regulatory risks (like restrictions on PFOF) could impact revenue. The challenge for Robinhood is retaining and expanding its user base in a crowded market.

The company’s growth prospects remain strong. It has multiple drivers for long-term expansion: new products like Robinhood Legend (advanced trading tools), futures trading, and international expansion into the UK and Asia-Pacific. The crypto boom has also revived Robinhood’s trading business—crypto trading revenue surged 700% YoY, and the acquisition of Bitstamp positions it to compete in the global crypto market. The recent TradePMR acquisition will also help Robinhood attract higher-net-worth clients in financial advisory services. With Gold subscriptions growing 86% YoY, and cash deposits and retirement accounts surging, Robinhood is increasing user monetization while broadening its customer base.

At \~$42 per share, Robinhood’s market cap is $37 billion. It trades at 27× 2024 earnings and \~10× sales—higher than legacy brokers but reasonable given its high margins and expansion potential. With $4.3B in cash and no major debt, Robinhood has a solid balance sheet. The company has even begun buying back shares ($257M in 2024), signaling confidence in future value.

The stock’s valuation scenarios offer a range of possibilities:

* **Base Case (\~$60, 42% upside):** If Robinhood maintains its projected 25% annual revenue growth, expands its financial services, and keeps profitability intact, a P/E of \~30× and continued strong cash flows could justify this valuation.
* **Bull Case (\~$90, 140% upside):** If crypto trading remains strong, international expansion accelerates, and higher monetization per user continues, revenue growth could exceed 30% CAGR, and investors may be willing to pay a premium multiple (P/E 40× or higher) for a dominant fintech player.
* **Bear Case (\~$31, -26% downside):** A market downturn, regulatory headwinds (such as restrictions on PFOF or crypto trading), or slower-than-expected growth could compress valuation multiples, leading to a re-rating closer to traditional brokers at \~20× P/E.

Robinhood is a high-growth fintech with strong execution. It has moved past its unprofitable early days and is now scaling profitably while adding new revenue streams. Short-term volatility is likely, but the long-term story remains compelling. At this price, there is less downside and lot more upside. For investors willing to ride the ups and downs, Robinhood looks like a solid long-term bet.

valueinvesting,"For me there are 2 sides to this the tangible and the intangibles, both are roughly equally as important and often the intangible leeks into the tangible (the numbers we shall say)

Intangibles are things like brand power, in consumer goods, switching costs that keep consumers in your ecosystem, or things like railroads where it would be cost prohibitive for someone else to come by and build out the infrastructure you already own 

The 2nd part is the tangible, the very first thing I look for to judge the tangible quality of a business, is high ROIC, I want a company that gets a good return on invested capital, 15% is a good business, 25-30% is a GREAT business, of course other things matter too such as growth etc… but fundamentally the best businesses are ones that can generate high returns without constantly having to plow all the money back into the business to continue to operate, an example of a capital efficient business would be Microsoft or Visa, they might spend 40 billion in capex to bring in 70 billion in revenue, now take for example an airline company like Southwest Airlines they might bring in 7 billion in revenue but they had to spend 6.8 billion in capex to get there, hopefully that explanation makes sense

(Edit) I had one more thought to add on this, when you are paying for growth the size of growth engine in the company is also important, for example Amazon has a huge growth engine inside their business wherein they can continue to plow all the money back into the business and generate returns although they only are at about 10% ROIC as I recall, however it still makes a great business because of the sheer scale at which they can effectively deploy capital, visa for example has an amazing 30% ROIC however lacks the internal growth engine of Amazon still a great business to own, and because of the nature of high ROIC and limited place to deploy capital internally they return a significant amount of capital to shareholders via buybacks",side tangible intangible roughly equally important often intangible leek tangible number shall say intangible thing like brand power consumer good switching cost keep consumer ecosystem thing like railroad would cost prohibitive someone else come build infrastructure already nd part tangible first thing look judge tangible quality business high roic want company get good return invested capital good business great business course thing matter growth etc fundamentally best business one generate high return without constantly plow money back business continue operate example capital efficient business would microsoft visa might spend billion capex bring billion revenue take example airline company like southwest airline might bring billion revenue spend billion capex get hopefully explanation make sense edit one thought add paying growth size growth engine company also important example amazon huge growth engine inside business wherein continue plow money back business generate return although roic recall however still make great business sheer scale effectively deploy capital visa example amazing roic however lack internal growth engine amazon still great business nature high roic limited place deploy capital internally return significant amount capital shareholder via buyback,Comment,['V'],Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,"In equity investing, there isn't a more costly mistake than confusing uncertainty with risk. This is a mistake no one can afford; So, lets break it down. But first a few definitions (As I see them).

**Risk** **= The probability of any Permanent loss of capital.**

**Uncertainty** **= The dispersion of potential future outcomes.**

When these two get confused, as is easily done, things often get thrown out that, when viewed properly, offer great opportunities.

To properly evaluate any asset you must deliniate these characteristics in you mind and gauge them separatley.

# Here are the steps in my thought process:

Ask yourself, ""What's the worst and best situation that might occur?"" This measures the breadth of uncertainty. The bigger the gap between the best and worst-case scenario, the more uncertainty. If you find yourself unable to predict the best and worst scenarios, throw it in the ""Too Hard Pile"".Most securities spend the majority of their time in the ""Range of Reasonableness"" where, given the best and worst situation, they trade at a price that will deliver an average market return. This is, however, decreasingly true the more uncertainty there is (the bigger the aforementioned gap).

Given you're reading this to gain an edge and stocks with average uncertainty yield an average return, we want to be looking for highly uncertain low-risk situations. Where there is an easily determined but massive gap between the best and worst scenarios and the market has discounted the asset to an unreasonably low valuation (in relation to the worst-case scenario) due to its irrational confusion between risk and uncertainty.

Given all this, above-average returns are found when a stream of cash flows from a equity shares (company) or other assets are highly uncertain (as defined above) but can be purchased at a price that results in a low probability of permanent capital loss.

This gap between probable worst scenarios value for a security and the price at which a security is purchased is your margin of safety, dictating your return and whether a bet is low risk.



**High Uncertainty / Low Risk is ""Where the Fi$h Are"".**

valueinvesting,"Western sentiment toward Chinese companies is clearly shifting. Today's Financial Times front page features a positive, occasionally laudatory article about Alibaba. Based on interviews with dozens of former and current employees, competitors, and analysts, the journalist primarily recounts facts already familiar to us. Alibaba's previous strategy (integrating online and offline retail) proved unsuccessful, with the company losing market share to PDD and ByteDance while simultaneously facing government pressure. Now, a light appears at the tunnel's end: Jack Ma is no longer an outcast, the company is divesting non-core assets, and showing promising AI developments. However, the article contains two observations new to me.

First, Alibaba's level of focus on AI is remarkable. We've already heard about their plan to allocate $50 billion to capex over the next three years. It turns out they also maintain one of China's largest teams dedicated to model training. Additionally, current CEO Eddie Wu, described as a ""tech guy,"" is compelling other divisions, including e-commerce, to implement AI. All departments' KPIs now include assessments of how they leverage AI for business growth.

Second, employee sentiment appears to be shifting positively. Constant management reshuffling and strategy changes (first offline+online integration, then division into six business units with potential spin-offs, followed by abandonment of this plan) negatively impacted team morale, causing many departures. According to FT sources, employees now have greater confidence in the company's direction. One interviewee even admitted nearly crying when the CEO articulated the ambitious goal of achieving AGI-providing something to believe in and strive toward. In essence, this represents a Chinese variant of Jim Collins' BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal). I believe the goal's feasibility matters less than its ability to unify and motivate.

Whether Alibaba will emerge as an AI leader and how much return their AI investments will generate remains an open question. However, I consider their renewed focus and enhanced employee motivation positive indicators.

I would draw a similar conclusion from multiples and long term interest rates - I think you're about right

Absolutely, the opposite is true. The majority of stock market returns since the GFC have come from multiple expansion, not earnings expansion. This made sense in a zero rates world, but not anymore. The market did briefly seem to respect rates in 2022, and the 10/2022 bottom was not an unreasonable valuation... but what has happened since then is hard to justify - it's been largely based on vibes and optimistic speculation about the future.

I would expect long term returns (10-20 years) in the US market to be poor from this point. Anyone who looks honestly at history and the current situation should reach the same conclusion.

# Reverse Engineering

This may not endear me to my peers in the investment business, but my advice to most readers is to start by piggybacking on the thinking of the best professionals. It will save you a great deal of research time, and time is indeed money. It's like having the answers in front of you when you take a math exam. And unlike an exam, which is to test whether you really can do math, in the investment competition you only need a few answers. Never fear, the great investors do the same thing. Almost all have networks, often with formal meetings, where they swap ideas with each other. And they constantly scrutinize each other's moves, using the publicly available techniques I am going to describe.

So how does one go about reverse engineering? The first step is to identify some fund managers whose way of thinking one finds congenial. If you like owning assets at a discount more than trying to prophesy the future, you may not be comfortable in the growth stock world, and should perhaps seek your bargains among the holdings of a few ""value"" funds instead. And if you find new technologies baffling, so be it-leave them aside. If, on the contrary, you enjoy looking ahead and aren't fond of the idea of owning a collection of cheap but dull companies, then pick and choose among the holdings of growth managers.

A technology or emerging-growth fund is much more likely to give you a good idea for a technology or emerging-growth investment than is a general fund, simply because the manager stands or falls by this one sector, in which he must therefore be well informed. The manager of a general fund will want it to be ""represented"" in each sector, and may thus choose a large, safe company rather than the smaller, less well known specialty company that is likely to be the big winner and which the specialty manager is specifically paid to find. It's just like dining out: You're more likely to find the best risotto in an Italian  restaurant than in a Howard Johnson's.

The periodic ""Roundtables"" of top investment professionals published in Barron's are of the utmost value. Some of the participants spend weeks preparing for these sessions, marshaling their ideas and brushing up on the facts.

You can save time by using services that sum up and to some extent analyze what a number of outstanding funds and investment managers are doing. One is much better off studying the moves of a buy-and-hold manager, such as Bill Ruane of Sequoia Fund, than one who likes rapidly getting in and out. Outstanding Investor Digest, at 14 East 4th Street, New York, NY 10012, publishes a series called Portfolio Reports that shows the stocks that a hundred or so superior managers have been buying, and the amounts. Another part of the same service shows which among these managers holds any given security. So if, for instance, you are interested in what Warren Buffett is up to, you can look up Berkshire Hathaway. A while back you could see that he was continuing to buy Wells Fargo, of which Berkshire then owned 6.5 million shares, worth $700 million, or 12 percent of the company. You could then see who else was buying Wells Fargo, and how much they owned.

In the issue I have in front of me, Wells Fargo was also bought by an affiliate of Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, another excellent investor. So the indications were favorable. A companion service of the same firm contains interviews with the same managers, and prints extracts from their reports to stockholders. If you liked what you heard, you could call Wells Fargo to ask for information.

A service called 13-D Research, Inc., at Southeast Executive Park, 100 Executive Drive, Brewster, NY 10509, shows which institutions hold interests in companies that have gone above the 5 percent level, and then discusses the companies and the apparent rationale for the purchase. Very helpful!

There are more complete descriptions of mutual fund and investment manager transactions, such as those of Vickers Stock Research Corporation, 226 New York Avenue, Huntington, NY 11743. Morningstar Inc., of 53 W. Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, IL 60604, gives excellent descriptions of mutual funds and their holdings. However, there are enough ideas in the Outstanding Investor series to give the reverse-engineering practitioner as much as he needs to chew on. In fact, you should hold down the number of managers you study, and be extremely selective about which ideas you pursue. Remember, you only need to find one good stock a year, but you do need to know more about it than most other people. So keep your quest focused!

You never quite know why a manager is making an initial purchase of a stock. If it is in a managed portfolio, the client may have directed the transaction. If it is in a fund, one submanager may be buying without real conviction, and may then turn around and sell again. So the most meaningful transaction is when an outstanding manager-what I call a ""master""-is adding systematically to an already substantial position, with a couple of other masters starting to follow suit.

On the sell side, one should be extremely wary if a manager who has been fond of a stock for years and thus knows it intimately has started to sell it.

If you are going into the reverse-engineering business systematically, you should ask for the reports of the mutual funds you are interested in, or buy a few shares to make things more interesting, and read what the manager says in his reports to shareholders. Some fund managers will send you copies of interviews they give to the financial press, which provide further insights.

As you collect a few dozen highly promising stocks in this way, you should see what Value Line has to say about them. How are the sales progressing, how are the profit margins and return on capital holding up, is the research and development budget being sustained, and so forth. If you like what you find, you should send to the companies for the published material, notably the annual and quarterly reports and the 10K and 10Q, and do further analysis. I suggest asking the share-holder relations representative, among your other questions, which press or other reports he thinks highly of. Here are two hints on that subject.

First, if it turns out that there has been little or no Wall Street research put out on the company recently, that's a good sign, not a bad one. It's much better if the stock is overlooked when you buy it, and discovery only comes later .\* Second, ask which broker seems to have the best understanding of the company. Sometimes it will be a nearby regional firm, little known to Wall Street, that follows the company because it's right under its nose. Eventually it gets to know the situation and the

========================

\* You're particularly safe if people don't know how to pronounce the company's name. When I first recommended the Harte-Hanks monopoly newspaper chain in Forbes (after which it went up 1,000%), it was usually pronounced ""Hearty-Hanks,"" so I called this the Hearty-Hanks Syndrome. Schering-Plough is another example: In the old days before it was understood, Schering-Plough used to rise in sympathy when International Harvester advanced on good news.

=========================

people intimately. Make contact with that firm and ask people's opinion. Buy a few shares through them to get their attention. They will be in a far better position to give you information on their corporate neighbor, whose managers they know personally, than will a big firm far away.

What if the company won't give you any more than the bare minimum of required information? My suggestion is that you just move on. One objective of the reverse-engineering exercise is to save time, so that you can identify promising targets as quickly as possible. If you encounter unexpected obstacles, why not proceed to an easier objective? There are other fish in the sea. And good companies are usually eager to oblige analysts: They want to be understood.

At the end of this entire process you will have winowed down from the thousands of possible stocks a handful whose logic you understand thus far. Note under each stock what elements you find attractive-who is buying it, what percentage is owned by institutions, and the other major factors in your decision to study it further.

The growth investor who is able to think independently can improve this process by figuring out when a holding has been bought because of an anticipated change for the better. Catching a change is the most profitable of all investment strategies. On the other hand, it is also a hard maneuver to execute, and getting it wrong can be costly. There is a big difference between a company that is already successfully doing something new and a company that hopes to succeed in the future: what Wall Street calls a ""story"" stock, in which even professionals usually lose money.

Reverse engineering works for countries as well as stocks. Let me give you an example. Everybody talks these days about the next Chile  or the next Taiwan, the way they used to talk about the next Japan. Which country will it be? Perhaps the greatest living new country picker is James Rogers, George Soros's first partner, and since then an eminent investor for his own account.

A few years ago, after a 65,000-mile trip the length and breadth of the globe, he announced to all who would listen that Peru was a buy. Peru! Almost nobody believed him. What about the Shining Path and the Fujimori coup d'état? It all seemed too much. Well, the whole Peru market promptly tripled. The hazards were already reflected in the prices.

Rogers then opined that Botswana looked good to him, and that he had bought all eleven stocks on the local stock exchange. Botswana! Not everybody's first choice ... one could almost say not anybody's first choice. Anyway, finding myself in Gabarone, the capital, some time ater I visited the local stockbroker-there's only one-and asked him to tell me the story. He was delighted. It all seems perfectly true.

Botswana (the former Bechuanaland) is a remarkably prosperous country, thanks to its vast diamond mines, and having only one dominant tribe, enjoys political stability. It has a government surplus, a trade surplus, and an investment surplus. Hard to find! Furthermore, if tranquility comes to South Africa, Botswana-as its neighbor and trading partner-should do even better than it has already. And the point is that thanks to Rogers I got the story quite a lot more easily than by traveling his 65,000 miles. Indeed, thanks to his hint, I could have done the job over the telephone. His latest wizard wheeze is Iran.

It seems that the ayatollahs have at last got the same word as everyone else, namely, that free enterprise and capital markets are the best way out of poverty. Still ... Iran!

You can also do all this by looking at the transactions in the best international funds, noting the countries they are going into, and then figuring out why. Apply the ""emerging-markets"" checklists on pp. 27- 28. Sometimes the fund manager will tell you, if you ask, even if he doesn't explain it in his quarterly report.

Kinda drunk but it's Friday on St.Paddy's eve and all my fake friends are drunk without me.

\*Macro Predictions: Big Short 2.0 - Auto Loan Bubble, Residential & (most likely) Commercial Real Estate loan bubble. All bundled together. Sound familiar. Think some of the banks got greedy and started offering bespoke tranches (we're in 0'7 the market just doesn't realize it yet and won't till 0'8). Stock picks to hedge against incoming recession.

1. OSCR - (Initiated a position as of this week it's cheap) - FWD P/E: 18.59, P/S: 0.38, P/B: 3.27, EV/Revenue - 0.23, Downside: Trailing is 128 (hehe - sorry I look for companies before they go big not after).  Sentiment - ""I literally just want affordable health insurance"" - every top comment on political posts. OSCR makes that happen comparatively so.
2. F - ""America first"" - FWD P/E: 7.15, Trailing: 6.66 (fair lmao), PEG: 3.11, P/S: 0.21, P/B: 0.86, EV/Rev: 0.87.  Auto industry is trading at historically low levels. 8-10x is fair given historical valuations. 6.5% dividend and Ford family isn't selling and neither is anyone in MI - don't give up on Ford just because of years of underperforming. Focus on stocks that return capital to shareholders in times of uncertainty.
3. XYZ/SQ (Block) - naming is annoying - this is undervalued come on. Double down from my last post the market is not giving this company enough credit. Growth at a reasonable price is the name of the game here. Trailing P/E: 12.55, FWD P/E: 13, PEG: 0.55, P/S: 1.51, P/B: 1.67. I posted about this at $80 ish and like point #4 suggested it went down 25% hehe. Either way, we pray for times like these. We're buying high quality merchandise at a discount. Hindenburg (love you guys), released a report saying most of these transactions go against the law and are criminals (drug dealers). Most banks on Wall Street did the same thing and still made billions. If I chose to not invest in anything because drug dealers and bad people used the system, we'd all be not on this thread. The system won't change that fast to prosecute these guys in the long run. And beyond some discretions, it's actually a well run company run by an actual visionary.
4. Any Airline - Seriously, this shit is cheap. I get people hating this and investing in an airline isn't really an investment, but doesn't change that you can make money off this. AAL (is unbelievably cheap - could be a value trap but wow), DAL, UAL. Rich people will continue to travel during a recession to show that they can, because they can. The hedge to this would be #5.

\- UAL: Trailing P/E: 7.8, FWD P/E : 6.39, PEG: 0.77, P/S: 0.43, P/B: 1.9

\- DAL: Trailing P/E: 8.77, FWD P/E: 6.48, PEG: 39.29?,P/S: 0.49, EVRevenue: 0.81, FCF Monster (only one of these guys that has it)

\- AAL:  Trailing P/E: 8.77, FWD P/E: 6.21, PEG: 0.2, P/S: 0.14, EV/Revenue: 0.7 - bad margins

5. Zoom - Watch the movie ""Up in the Air"" with George Clooney and Anna Kendrick. If we head towards a recession and corporate travel is cut, then we expect more people to take virtual meetings. Not value again in the traditional sense. But value is all determined based off what people are willing to pay in the future.  Zoom is the best platform for taking physical meetings virtually. (sorry Teams - everyone hates using you\]). Trailing P/E: 23.12, FWD P/E: 13.61, PEG: 2.71, P/S: 5, P/B: 2.53.

Again - this isn't actually value so I apologize, but it's a hedge for the above which are value. Either people are going to travel for work or they aren't, why not have long exposure to both.

Disclaimer: None of the views reflect the company I work for. All views are my own. I work in tech relax - I googled all of this. The running joke when I was studying at Michigan was as follows. EECS (name of the department at our school)- We all have dreams in CS, but the EE stands for eventually Econ. Here we are.

\*Other things to consider: I was wrong about C bank. I still think it's undervalued, but their exposure to securities under the MTM framework is concerning. I hope Jane leads them out of this mess that she inherited.

Most use a 2-stage DCF that discounts cash flow for each individual year, then slaps on terminal value which can by itself, drive the majority of the valuation. 

I feel this is the worst way to model a range of future cash flows. Any small change in a growth rate puts you in a completely different ballpark.

I still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true. So just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.

valueinvesting,"Monetary and fiscal policies are very powerful. Put it crudely, they will fuck up all your investment thesis. It is not unreasonable to trim some shares or buy puts to hedge your portfolio.

You may point to the past on how holding stocks through dips and crashes work, but that is because the Fed and Congress worked together in 2008 and 2020 to restore the economy.

Fed played a huge role from 2010 to 2020 with its easy money policy. Buffett has pointed this out in his shareholder letter by saying that the investing game is rigged.

Yes, this time is different. Trump and the Congress are planning a structural change in how the US is governed.

US equity is also valued very richly and it is not unreasonble to trim some. S&P 500’s equity risk premium was 4% in 2024. This is the lowest since the previous low of 2.91% in 2001 (https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/histimpl.html). Stock return is looking like the years after 2000.

The bonds are finally having decent yields. Even without Trump's tariff, it is not unreasonable to roate out of equity. Big money is thinking, there isn't much yield in equity compared to risk free bonds, why not switch over.

What many people are saying here about macroeconomic trends is surely true for builders. But I have noticed huge differences between individual house builders in the US depending on their business model - e.g. markets where they operate, price points they sell at, management execution, etc.

GRBK has been pretty much shielded from all the downsides which hit the builders over the last few years,. including Covid and interest rate increases. Since 2017 they have grown revenues at around 25% p.a. and EPS at approx. double that rate.

When evaluating house builders, I focus on returns on capital and leverage. Operating efficiency is also very important as I expect some economies of scale as the builder is growing.

valueinvesting,"Hey - sure. First, he is not nor ever was the singer in Disturbed. He owns a boat called “the Contrarian” and he is Canadian.

He used psychology as an investing tool believing there were market inefficiencies because of it. 

I did a little digging in ChatGPT for his greatest hits, this is a pretty good dossier. 

Dreman’s research showed that investors consistently overreact to earnings surprises, economic forecasts, and news events, leading to systematic mispricing. He used fundamental analysis to take advantage of these inefficiencies.

His strategy was not about finding the “perfect” stock but buying strong companies at bargain prices and waiting for the market to correct its misjudgments.

Some of his most notable contrarian trades include:

1. Betting on Financial Stocks After the 2008 Crisis
	•	During the Great Financial Crisis (2008-2009), while most investors fled financial stocks, Dreman bought banks and insurance companies that had been crushed.
	•	He invested in Bank of America, Citigroup, and other financial institutions, believing the market had overreacted to the crisis.
	•	These positions initially struggled, but many recovered as the financial system stabilized.

2. Investing in Energy Stocks When Oil Collapsed
	•	Dreman often bought energy stocks when oil prices were down, believing that the market had overly punished the sector.
	•	He applied this approach multiple times, betting on oil companies when others were selling out of fear.

3. Buying Tobacco Stocks When They Were Unpopular
	•	In the 1990s and early 2000s, as tobacco stocks faced lawsuits and public backlash, Dreman invested in companies like Philip Morris (now Altria).
	•	These companies had strong cash flows and high dividend yields, fitting his value criteria.

4. Contrarian Tech Investments After the Dot-Com Bust
	•	After the 2000 dot-com crash, he selectively invested in tech and telecom stocks that had been heavily oversold.
	•	He avoided overhyped companies but looked for established firms with real earnings that had been unfairly dragged down.

5. Betting on Depressed Blue-Chip Stocks
	•	Dreman often bought large-cap, well-established companies that had been temporarily beaten down due to bad earnings reports or negative news.
	•	He believed in mean reversion, where out-of-favor stocks tend to bounce back once market fears subside.

While many of his bets worked out, some—like his financial sector investments in 2008-2009—took longer to recover than he expected. Dreman always emphasized that contrarian investing requires patience and the ability to withstand short-term pain in order to reap long-term gains.

His approach wasn’t about chasing hype or momentum but about buying strong businesses at deeply discounted prices and waiting for the market to correct its overreaction.

Here are the fundamental factors he found most valuable:

1. Valuation Metrics
	•	Low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio – He preferred stocks with low P/E ratios, as they tend to outperform high P/E stocks over time.
	•	Low Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio – Companies trading below their book value often indicate deep value opportunities.
	•	Low Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF) Ratio – A low P/CF ratio suggests a company is generating strong cash flows relative to its market price.
	•	Low Price-to-Dividend Ratio – Companies with higher dividend yields relative to their price can signal undervaluation.

2. Financial Health Indicators
	•	Strong Earnings Growth (but not overhyped) – He looked for companies with stable, consistent earnings rather than explosive, speculative growth.
	•	Solid Balance Sheet – Companies with low debt and strong assets were preferred to avoid financial distress.
	•	Positive Cash Flow – Reliable free cash flow generation indicated a company’s ability to reinvest in growth and weather downturns.",hey sure first ever singer disturbed owns boat called contrarian canadian used psychology investing tool believing market inefficiency little digging chatgpt greatest hit pretty good dossier dreman research showed investor consistently overreact earnings surprise economic forecast news event leading systematic mispricing used fundamental analysis take advantage inefficiency strategy finding perfect stock buying strong company bargain price waiting market correct misjudgments notable contrarian trade include betting financial stock crisis great financial crisis investor fled financial stock dreman bought bank insurance company crushed invested bank america citigroup financial institution believing market overreacted crisis position initially struggled many recovered financial system stabilized investing energy stock oil collapsed dreman often bought energy stock oil price believing market overly punished sector applied approach multiple time betting oil company others selling fear buying tobacco stock unpopular early tobacco stock faced lawsuit public backlash dreman invested company like philip morris altria company strong cash flow high dividend yield fitting value criterion contrarian tech investment dot com bust dot com crash selectively invested tech telecom stock heavily oversold avoided overhyped company looked established firm real earnings unfairly dragged betting depressed blue chip stock dreman often bought large cap well established company temporarily beaten due bad earnings report negative news believed mean reversion favor stock tend bounce back market fear subside many bet worked like financial sector investment took longer recover expected dreman always emphasized contrarian investing requires patience ability withstand short term pain order reap long term gain approach chasing hype momentum buying strong business deeply discounted price waiting market correct overreaction fundamental factor found valuable valuation metric low price earnings p e ratio preferred stock low p e ratio tend outperform high p e stock time low price book p b ratio company trading book value often indicate deep value opportunity low price cash flow p cf ratio low p cf ratio suggests company generating strong cash flow relative market price low price dividend ratio company higher dividend yield relative price signal undervaluation financial health indicator strong earnings growth overhyped looked company stable consistent earnings rather explosive speculative growth solid balance sheet company low debt strong asset preferred avoid financial distress positive cash flow reliable free cash flow generation indicated company ability reinvest growth weather downturn,Comment,"['BAC', 'C']",Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,"Several of President Donald Trump's policies and actions are raising concerns among economists about the potential for a U.S. recession in 2025. Here are the key factors contributing to these fears:

Tariffs and Trade Policy: 
Trump has recently imposed significant tariffs, including 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico and increased duties on Chinese goods, which have disrupted supply chains, raised consumer prices, and hurt businesses reliant on international trade.

Retaliatory Measures: Countries like Canada and China have retaliated with their own tariffs, further straining U.S. exports and trade relationships.

2. Impact on Consumer Spending:
Tariffs are driving up prices on everyday items, from groceries to car parts, which could reduce consumer spending—an essential driver of the U.S. economy. Recent data shows declining consumer confidence, which is critical for sustaining economic activity.

3. Immigration Crackdown & Labor Shortages: Strict immigration policies are exacerbating labor shortages in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare. This limits productivity and raises costs for businesses and consumers.

4. Stock Market Volatility: 
The stock market has reacted negatively to Trump's tariff policies, with indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experiencing significant drops over the past few weeks. While not directly indicative of a recession, this volatility undermines investor confidence.

5. Federal Employment Cuts: 
Trump's administration has made major cuts to federal employment, which could lead to reduced consumer spending by affected workers and slow job growth in other sectors.

6. Potential GDP Contraction: 
The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has projected that U.S. economic output could shrink in the first quarter of 2025, raising concerns about a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth).


While Trump has acknowledged that his policies might cause a ""period of transition,"" he insists they will ultimately benefit the economy. However, economists remain skeptical, citing these policies as significant risks to economic stability in the near term.",several president donald trump policy action raising concern among economist potential u recession key factor contributing fear tariff trade policy trump recently imposed significant tariff including import canada mexico increased duty chinese good disrupted supply chain raised consumer price hurt business reliant international trade retaliatory measure country like canada china retaliated tariff straining u export trade relationship impact consumer spending tariff driving price everyday item grocery car part could reduce consumer spending essential driver u economy recent data show declining consumer confidence critical sustaining economic activity immigration crackdown labor shortage strict immigration policy exacerbating labor shortage key sector like agriculture construction healthcare limit productivity raise cost business consumer stock market volatility stock market reacted negatively trump tariff policy index like p nasdaq experiencing significant drop past week directly indicative recession volatility undermines investor confidence federal employment cut trump administration made major cut federal employment could lead reduced consumer spending affected worker slow job growth sector potential gdp contraction federal reserve bank atlanta projected u economic output could shrink first quarter raising concern technical recession two consecutive quarter negative growth trump acknowledged policy might cause period transition insists ultimately benefit economy however economist remain skeptical citing policy significant risk economic stability near term,Body,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

Got me thinking: if stocks go sideways but earnings keep growing at the normal 6-8% per year, how long before valuations look normal again?

Did the math and it's about 5-7 years of sideways action while earnings compound. Take Apple for example - they're at a P/E of 31 vs their historical 20 ([https://valuesense.io/ticker/aapl](https://valuesense.io/ticker/aapl)). If their stock price freezes but earnings keep growing at 10% annually, they'd be back to normal in about 4.5 years. Pretty wild, right?

Some analysts are actually projecting 15% earnings growth for 2025, which would speed things up, but who knows with all these tariff threats and policy chaos floating around. Plus, let's be real - the market is basically 7 mega-cap tech companies (making up \~30% of the index) and then everything else. Strip those out, and the rest of the market actually looks way more reasonably priced.

I keep seeing this argument that we've got more retail investors than ever pumping money into the market, especially with how easy apps make it to invest now. Is this really creating a ""new normal"" for P/E ratios? Or is this just the same old ""this time it's different"" BS we always hear at market peaks?

Even if no 20-year period has ever produced negative returns, a market that goes nowhere for 5+ years is still terrible for anyone buying in now. You're basically just losing to inflation the whole time.

valueinvesting,"The past year has been a challenging one for the automotive industry. Across the board, automakers are facing headwinds as consumers hesitate to spend on new vehicles, a trend reflected in the latest financial reports. Mercedes-Benz Group’s Q4 2024 earnings confirm this difficult environment.

**At first glance, revenue declined by 4% compared to 2023**, while earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 24%, now hovering just above €10.1. Free cash flow also took a hit, falling 19% to €9.2 billion.

Despite these pressures, Mercedes-Benz has maintained a strong financial position. The company kept its net industrial liquidity at a high level—up 1% year-over-year—to a robust €31.4 billion. This provides significant financial flexibility in a challenging market.

In a move to reassure investors, the company returned **nearly €10 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks**. With this, the leadership aims to signal confidence in the company’s strength and its ability to navigate the uncertainties ahead.

# Key Numbers of the Mercedes-Benz Group

Now that we've looked at the yearly trends, let's break things down on a quarterly level. The graph below shows a noticeable decline in Q4 over the past two years, with revenue dropping by more than €2.5 billion. At the same time, net profit took a sharp fall from €4 billion in Q4 2022 to just €2.4 billion in the latest quarter.

One positive takeaway is that R&D spending has remained relatively stable. According to **CEO Ola Källenius**, **2024 marked a year of major technological and product innovations**, many of which will roll out in 2025 and 2026. One of the most notable highlights from their latest presentation is the “insanely performant electric G,” a model the company is betting on to reinforce its position in the TEV (Top End Vehicle) market.

# Segment Revenue of Marcedes-Benz Group

Q4 is typically a strong quarter for Mercedes-Benz Group (MBG) due to tax optimization strategies and seasonal demand. However, in Q4 2024, revenue declined by 3.8% compared to Q4 2023. Among all segments, MBG Cars saw the smallest decline at just -1%, while both MBG Vans and Mercedes-Benz Mobility experienced steeper drops of around -11%.

Looking at the full year, the picture shifts slightly. The group's total revenue fell by approximately 4.5%, with **both the Cars and Vans segments experiencing a similar decline of around -4.5%**. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz Mobility showed more resilience, with a smaller decrease of -1.9%, this is widely anticipated because of different type of business with its own cycles.

An interesting takeaway is that while MBG Vans saw the largest revenue drop, its gross profit decline was the most moderate at -8%. In contrast, **MBG Cars and MBG Mobility** faced steeper gross profit contractions of **-19.5% and -24.6%, respectively**.

Despite these shifts, MBG Cars remains the group's primary profit driver. Its gross profit for 2024 stands at €21,570 million—nearly four times the combined profit of the Vans and Mobility segments, though down from €26,786 million in 2023.

# Revenue by Region

Another key topic is revenue by region. It's well known that luxury Western brands have been facing increasing challenges in the Asian market, particularly in China, which accounts for around 60% of all sales in the region. In 2024, both Asia and **China saw revenue declines of approximately -8.5%**. While this may seem significant, it pales in comparison to the downturn in Germany—the largest European economy—where revenue dropped by -11.9%. Across the entire **European market**, the d**ecline was more moderate at -3.8%**.

Germany's ongoing economic struggles, now in their second year, have made car sales to domestic customers particularly difficult. This is especially evident when comparing relative growth between 2022 and 2023, where revenue in the same market had increased by 11.8%.

Meanwhile, North America and the U.S. experienced relatively smaller declines, with revenue dropping by -3.9% and -3.2%, respectively.

# MBG Cars - Unit Sales by Product Categories

One of the most intriguing insights from the financial report is the shift in unit sales across different product categories. As shown in the graph below, sales declined in all Mercedes-Benz Cars segments—except for the Core category (which includes models like the C-Class, E-Class, GLC, and GLE). This segment saw a **notable 6.4% increase in sales**, demonstrating its resilience in a challenging market.

The Core segment remains the backbone of MBG Cars, accounting for **1.16 million units sold**—almost four times larger than Top-End sales and twice the size of the Entry segment.

Meanwhile, **Top-End and Entry models were significantly impacted by weaker demand in Germany**, with sales declining by **14.2% and 13.6%, respectively**. This highlights the challenges faced in the luxury and entry-level markets, particularly in regions experiencing economic slowdowns.

Electric vehicle sales have been a hot topic, and one surprising takeaway from the latest report is that **electrified vehicles accounted for 19.3% of total unit sales**—a slight decline compared to the previous year (21.8%). This aligns with the reduction in government incentives, yet the numbers remain strong, reflecting continued demand for electrified models.

Comparing 2023 to 2024, MBG Cars saw a **13.2% increase in Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle (PHEV) sales**, while overall electrified vehicle sales declined by 8.5% year-over-year. This shift suggests a changing landscape within the EV market, where hybrid technology is gaining traction despite an overall slowdown in electrified vehicle sales.

# Conclusion

2024 appears to be a year of significant investments in research & development and the expansion of the Mercedes-Benz charging network. While the impact of R&D efforts on profit margins and sales growth remains to be seen, the charging infrastructure is already enhancing the experience for **electrified vehicle owners**.

A clear industry trend is emerging: **automakers are striving to control the entire driving experience, from vehicle operation to charging**. Unlike internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, where refueling was independent of manufacturers, the shift toward fully autonomous vehicles **necessitates in-house charging solutions**. Achieving seamless, automated charging is far easier with proprietary infrastructure than relying on third-party stations.

Meanwhile, economic challenges persist. **Germany's ongoing recession**, **market instability in China**, and the **U.S.'s unpredictable tariff policies** are adding uncertainty to the industry. However, despite these headwinds, I hold a strong position in Mercedes-Benz with an average price of €53. In my view, anything below €57 represents a safe buying opportunity, especially considering the company’s strong dividend yield.

While risks in the automotive sector are evident—**particularly for luxury brands**—long-term opportunities remain. Over time, **we can expect increased investor interest in this segment**, driven by innovation and strategic positioning.

valueinvesting,"I'm largely an AWS guy but have dabbled all over. Github is ran by the same company they bought it from. They are their own separate deal and aren't cloud developers/engineers. It's honestly not that big a deal since most shops likely run their own instances of github outside of it anyway and you can connect to the cloud via SDK's or still integrate through IDE's (like VS code) if you want to. 

Furthermore, saying ""developer"" and ignoring  potential dev's that may focus on .NET, C#, etc. probably isn't fair. AWS and Google Cloud also have a crap ton of alternatives to other tools that are shittier. I'm not even defending MS or any one of them. I just know for a fact they ALL have strengths and weaknesses so you can't blanketly say any of them don't do what you said in the latter. ALL OF THEM will try and sell you on **THEIR SOLUTION(S).** They'll tell you they're the best and they're alll need across the board.

It's up to your actual cloud architects, devs, etc to piece together the tech stack and read past any BS, but you'd be naive to think AWS or Google cloud is gonna say ""yeah just go with someone else's tool instead of ours.""",largely aws guy dabbled github ran company bought separate deal cloud developer engineer honestly big deal since shop likely run instance github outside anyway connect cloud via sdk still integrate ide like v code want furthermore saying developer ignoring potential dev may focus net c etc probably fair aws google cloud also crap ton alternative tool shittier even defending m one know fact strength weakness blanketly say said latter try sell solution tell best alll need across board actual cloud architect devs etc piece together tech stack read past b naive think aws google cloud gonna say yeah go someone else tool instead,Comment,['MS'],Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,"True without a doubt. It's not really all about money. 

At the same time, I have been more than happy to use the index at many points in my investing life. The index often can be a great tool. 

Indexing is a way to practice not-knowing as recommended by the great Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu. Diversification is also great insurance against the unknown, not to mention single-firm problems like a bad controlling shareholder. 

My problem with the indexes, specifically in recent years, is that their valuations have come unhinged. I fully intend to drop a substantial amount of capital into low-cost indexes when their valuations return to being consistent with financial common sense. Note, Treasury money markets have a higher yield than the earnings yield of the S&P 500.",true without doubt really money time happy use index many point investing life index often great tool indexing way practice knowing recommended great chinese philosopher lao tzu diversification also great insurance unknown mention single firm problem like bad controlling shareholder problem index specifically recent year valuation come unhinged fully intend drop substantial amount capital low cost index valuation return consistent financial common sense note treasury money market higher yield earnings yield p,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,"I approach my selling entirely differently. 

I think of it as risk exposure. Basically, when I buy for the first time I have a series of targets - I think of them like compartments in an ice cube tray. As the stock price appreciates, more and more compartments are filled in the tray. Before I even buy the first share, I outline how fast I believe the compartments will fill. Such that, maybe I believe 5 compartments will be filled in 3 years, maybe 9 in 6, etc. But if I wind up with 7 compartments filled in the first year, I may seriously consider selling or trimming because the probability that I get to buy back into an emptier ice cube tray in that same time period is higher because of how volatile individual stocks are. If there's nothing attractive at the time, then I may hold. An example was Ally Financial. I thought it was worth 44$ a share. When Silicon Valley Bank died, it dropped to 19$ a share and I bought tons of it starting at 22$ a share. But within the space of a year it had reached 44$ against and I sold all of it. Today it sits at 32$/share, but there's lots that's changed about the company so I don't think I'll be buying back in. 

It's the same for buying on the way down. I have an amount that I think present a very attractive margin of safety, but sometimes you get lucky and you can buy in more cheaply, so I set targets at -15%, -25% and so on with corresponding exposures. For example at -50% I'm content to let the stock become 20% of my account. An example of this behavior was Ali Baba. My first buy was at 78$ towards the end of 2023, the I bought substantially more at 72$, and then I bought a LOT at 67$. Now it's at 140. The ice cube tray is pretty full, but I think it's mostly where it ought to be we'll see if it continues to outpace what it's CAGR will probably be or if it falls back down. 

I rarely sell stocks to buy other stocks unless the value proposition is just STUPID. 

  
Value investing is a confluence of 3 factors - one that you're right about the price that you buy in at relative to the true value of the security, two (in long term holding) that you're right about the annual growth rate into the future, such that holding nets you an above average return, and 3 that all of your calculations are borne out swiftly enough that the opportunity cost of sitting in the security doesn't eventually cause the gains to be below average.",approach selling entirely differently think risk exposure basically buy first time series target think like compartment ice cube tray stock price appreciates compartment filled tray even buy first share outline fast believe compartment fill maybe believe compartment filled year maybe etc wind compartment filled first year may seriously consider selling trimming probability get buy back emptier ice cube tray time period higher volatile individual stock nothing attractive time may hold example ally financial thought worth share silicon valley bank died dropped share bought ton starting share within space year reached sold today sits share lot changed company think buying back buying way amount think present attractive margin safety sometimes get lucky buy cheaply set target corresponding exposure example content let stock become account example behavior ali baba first buy towards end bought substantially bought lot ice cube tray pretty full think mostly ought see continues outpace cagr probably fall back rarely sell stock buy stock unless value proposition stupid value investing confluence factor one right price buy relative true value security two long term holding right annual growth rate future holding net average return calculation borne swiftly enough opportunity cost sitting security eventually cause gain average,Comment,['ICE'],Banks & Finance

valueinvesting,"From 1977 through 1990 the US financialized its economy.  In 1977 almost no one had a credit card.  By 1990, credit card companies were signing up college freshman. 

It was not a difficult era to make money. Which is why so many retiring baby boomers have lots of money. It also wasn't a difficult era to get people to give you money either.

Mortgage rates were in the 10% range the whole time so people couldn't move, so they fixed up their own houses. Buying Lowe's was pretty obvious.

But, he missed all the best stocks of the era like Microsoft, Apple, Walmart, Gap, Bancorp, Nike. 

His returns aren't that spectacular when consider stocks like Walmart went up 12000%. 

All you have to do to 2x the S&P is run 2x leverage in a bull market. And all you have to do to beat the S&P is hedge really well at the same time. He beat the S&P for 11 out of 13 years. So what?

When you hear his fund started with $10MM and ended with $10B that isn't because he traded to that level. It's because he opened new accounts and that was his real skill. Peter is a master salesman. 

Fund manager's write books and have publicists to pay for proper placement in the media and run ad campaigns just like modern day influencers on YouTube. And it's all to bring people to their investments. 

Paul Tudor Jones (another billionaire) is most famous for a trade he got completely wrong. In fact, he appears to have spent years trying to remove documentaries about him during the run up to this trade because it shows just how wrong he was. The Black Monday crash had nothing to do with Elliot Waves or correlation to 1929, it was a code bug that handled portfolio insurance. Something he didn't even know existed. He made 70% in day.

I also think concentration and active weighting matter—I’m not blindly mirroring the S&P 500 but making high-conviction bets where I see asymmetric upside. As for the risk of these companies losing their edge, I completely agree that no company is untouchable, which is why I plan to actively monitor fundamentals and adjust as needed.

valueinvesting,"Sure! I kept it short to make it more digestible, as many people may find regression uninteresting. But perhaps this has had the opposite effect. My goal was to keep the technical details minimal while focusing more on the outcomes. However, I'd be happy to elaborate further!

Regression Model:

Let's start with regression. I used a simple Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model:

y=a+bx

Here, y is expressed as a function of x using two coefficients:

\* a (intercept): The value of y when x = 0.

\* b (coefficient): The slope, representing the relationship between x and y.

In this case, I provided growth (x) and the corresponding valuation multiple from the DCF (y) to the model. This means the regression expresses valuation multiple as a function of growth. If we input an expected growth rate into the formula, it outputs the valuation multiple that a DCF analysis (under the same assumptions) would generate.

Since we know that at zero growth, the valuation multiple should be 1/10% = 10, I fixed the intercept at 10. The coefficient b is then calculated using the OLS method.

Mean Reversion Model:

The mean reversion model is straightforward. Research suggests that excess returns on capital tend to revert to the cost of equity within 10 years. If a company reinvests 100% of its earnings, its theoretical earnings growth should equal its ROIC (Return on Invested Capital).

For example, if a company's ROIC is 25% and its cost of equity is 10%, the excess return of 15% (25% - 10%) will likely dissipate over a 10-year period. Therefore, for DCF models where projected growth exceeds 10%, I adjusted the growth rate linearly so that it converges to 10% by year 10.

Since compounding at high growth rates leads to exponential valuation effects, a standard 10-year DCF model results in an exponential function. However, by incorporating mean reversion, the relationship between growth and valuation multiple becomes linear again. The coefficient 1.3 is then calculated using the same OLS regression approach as before. And yes, I rounded 0.9 and 1.3 for simplicity.

Practical Implications:

While growth projections are rarely reliable, they are essential in valuation. Too often, growth is projected too far into the future.

For example, some may justify Nvidia's current valuation using the model above. If Nvidia sustains 20–25% growth for 10 years, a P/E ratio of \~50 would be justified. However, such prolonged high growth is unlikely due to the mean-reverting nature of ROIC and growth.

Because the models have high R² values, their outputs closely approximate a full DCF analysis. As value investors, we rely on DCF to estimate intrinsic value. These formulas serve as a quick yet reasonably accurate estimation method—usable with just a phone calculator.

For example, a full DCF model gives a multiple of 18.4 for 10% growth over 5 years, while the formula provides:

10+(0.87×10)=18.7

By refining the formula's accuracy, it becomes more practical and useful. However, its reliability still depends on how well we predict growth and how long it will persist.

Hopefully, this explains all your questions.

valueinvesting,"How old are you?

If you're under 50, what you do is this:

\- Take $4k and buy a broad based index fund. Nothing gimmicky. A straight up S&P or Total Market index ETF. You will never sell this. Not even if you have found the absolutely best investment in the world. Not if you hate the president. Not if you're really scared and the news is telling you that the world is ending. You never sell this.

\- Take the other $2k and buy 8-12 high quality companies. These companies should be larger in size with strong cash flows and spread across some different areas of the economy/sectors. A few names I'd suggest taking a look at are: AVGO, C, ASML, CTRA, JPM, GOOG, ABBV, RTX, GD, UBER, etc... really depends on how old you are though. If you are younger, you should own some more tech/comm. services. If you are older, you can lean a little heavier in things that generate income and are in more steady businesses like O, EPD (if in a taxable account) and consumer staples.   
  
\-The goal is to buy \~10 stocks that you will hold forever; though that's not going to happen for all of them. You should split the $3k equally between these companies (don't put more into one and less into another). 

\- Don't worry too much about price or what the market is going to do in the next few months or couple years. Stay up on all news related to the companies, actually READ their quarterly/annual reports (something you should do before you buy). Read the ACTUAL news and data related to the companies, not what other people are saying or pontificating about, but you should RARELY trade on this news. 

\- A year from now, take a good hard look at what you own. Why did you buy these companies? Are those reasons still intact? Look at their actual earnings- are they growing? Are their margins increasing? What is management saying about the business? If their financials are not improving (that's okay! happens to every company!) why is this happening? Is this a cyclical downturn or something more? Are the investing in the business? Has anything happened that will change the ability of this business to deliver value ten years from now? Your instinct is going to be to react to everything: DON'T. React to fundamentals, not to price.

\- If anything has changed the company fundamentally for the long-term, sell it and buy another ""hold forever"" stock. The first few years, you may end up replacing up to a third of the companies, but the better you get at this, the less that will happen. If you are replacing a lot of the stocks and/or continuing to do so after the first couple of years, it's due to: 1) you aren't picking the companies that are of high enough quality and/or 2) You're not being patient enough and reacting to short-term developments.

valueinvesting,"I'm a huge ""Dividend Growth"" proponent, but given your age I wouldn't worry as much about dividends as I would about things taking advantage of tax-advantaged account options and consistently putting money into the market. 

If you are going to invest in dividend stocks, I would highly recommend focusing on dividend growth rather than chasing high dividend yields. It is important to remember that dividends are not as tax efficient as capital appreciation (if your investing in a taxable account) and that companies paying high dividends are going to have much lower growth prospect by default. 

I don't know if you have to use UCITS funds or all that much about the tax situation where you live, but in general some great dividend growth ETFs are: NOBL, SCHD and DGRW. 

Some great dividend growth stocks for someone your age might be companies like AVGO, ITW, AOS, PEP, ABBV, NWG, etc... you may look at a stock like AVGO and think ""it only pays 1%"" but that is because the stock has risen as fast, or faster than the dividend. For example, ITW was trading at \~$14.50 a share 30 years and paying annual dividends of $.08 per share for a yield of 1.1%. Today, trading at $275, paying $6 per share and has a yield of 2.26%. It's raised it's dividend every single year. If you put 10k in the stock back then and reinvested the dividends, you'd have over $320k today and be generating an income of nearly $40k. 

Some good broad market index ets are VOO (S&P 500), QQQ (NASDAQ, VGK (Europe), VT or URTH. There are others as well, but do your own research and look at expenses and that sort of thing.

Good afternoon, and welcome to r/dividends.  We are a community by and for dividend growth investors.  Our community was started all the way back in 2009 as a discussion forum for dividend investors.  Whether you are just starting out in your investing journey, or are months away from retirement, we hope you will find enjoyment in participating with this online community.  This post will go over absolutely everything you need to get started in the world of dividend investing.  Whether you are new or have been investing for years, it is well worth a read.

**Part 0: What are dividends exactly?**

From Investopedia:

>A dividend is the distribution of some of a company's earnings to a class of its shareholders, as determined by its board of directors.  Common shareholders of dividend-paying companies are typically eligible as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date.  Dividends may be paid out as cash or in the form of additional stock.[^([1])](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp)

Dividend investors are those who incorporate dividend payers into their portfolio.

**Part I: Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of dividend payers**

Dividend payers tend to be big, well-established companies that have an abundance of cash.  According to Steve Greiner, Vice President of Charles Schwab Equity Ratings^(®), *""They \[dividend payers\] often can't compete with the rapid appreciation of fledgling, fast-growing companies, so they use dividend payouts as an enticement.""*  Because of this, many newer investors often think of dividend payers as being the opposite of so-called ""growth stocks.""  In reality, it is usually dividend-paying securities that produce more growth over a long period of time.

Dividends, when reinvested, can significantly boost total returns over time, making dividend-paying stocks an attractive option for older and younger investors alike.  For example, if you invested $1,000 USD in a hypothetical investment that tracked the S&P 500 Index on January 1, 1990, but did not reinvest the dividends, your investment would have been worth $8,982 USD at the end of 2019.  If you **had** reinvested the dividends, you would have ended up with $16,971 - nearly doubling your returns.  The longer the timeframe, the more dramatic the disparity.  According to research conducted by the Hartford Funds, ""Dividends have played a significant role in the returns investors have received during the past 50 years.  Going back to 1970, a whopping 84% of the total return of the S&P 500 index can be attributed to reinvested dividends and the power of compounding.""[^([2])](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/market-perspectives/the-power-of-dividends.html)  Drawing from the decades of data available, intentionally excluding dividends from your portfolio could result in significantly handicapping your portfolio for decades.

With the S&P 500 yielding approximately 1.52% as of December 31, 2020, dividends paying securities can serve as an attractive alternative to Treasuries and other fixed income investments often pushed by professional retirement planners.

The downside to dividends is that they are not guaranteed.  This is important information to consider, as companies can and will stop paying dividends if necessary, or worse, if legally required.  Certain market conditions like the 2020 coronavirus pandemic can create an uncertain environment for dividend-focused companies.  In 2020, 68 of the roughly 380 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500 suspended or reduced their payouts.[^([4])](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/2020-dividends-a-year-in-review-1029885286)

Fortunately, companies generally only cut their dividends when they are in distress, so favoring those with sound financial metrics can help mitigate the risk.

**Part II: Understanding how to pick dividend stocks**

If you create a post in the r/dividends subreddit asking for a list of good companies that pay dividends, your submission will be removed.  This is because this community believes firmly in the ""teach someone to fish"" mentality.  Instead of asking for a list of dividend payers, it is far more valuable instead to understand the fundamental ideas behind why specific individuals choose specific companies.  By knowing and understanding these principles, you can build your own portfolio that, if properly executed, could beat 90% of lay investors with relatively little effort.  While far from comprehensive, these six tips can help you identify dividend-paying stocks with strong financial health.

***#1.*** ***Do not chase high dividend yields:***  If a company has a high dividend yield, there is always a reason (most of the time not a good one) that a security is offering payouts that are well above average.  A good rule of thumb is that before you purchase a high-yield security (those with a yield of 5% or more), try to determine why it is so high.  It is important to note however, that the dividend yield is not a fixed amount, but in reality changes every second a stock is traded.  According to Investopedia:

>The dividend yield, expressed as a percentage, is a financial ratio (dividend/price) that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.[^([3])](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendyield.asp)

If a high or rising yield is due to a shrinking share price, that is a bad sign and could indicate that a dividend cut is in a company's future.  However, if a rising dividend yield is due to rising profits, that indicates a more favorable scenario.  When net profits rise, dividends tend to follow suit.  Make sure you know exactly what is causing the increase before buying the stock.

***#2. Assess the payout ratio:*** This metric (calculated by dividing dividends per share over earnings per share) tells you how much of a company's earnings are going toward the dividend.  A ratio higher than 100% means the company is paying out more to its shareholders than it is earning.  In such cases, it may be able to cover its dividends from available cash, but that can only last for so long.

If a company whose stock you own is losing money but still paying a dividend for an extended period, it may be time to sell off and cut your losses.  US tax law allows you to write off up to $3,000 per year in capital losses in exchange for a tax credit.  Your circumstances may vary, so check your local tax authority.  The reason you may want to consider this option is because dividend payers in financial hard times may try to stave off a dividend cut by funding payouts with borrowed funds or cash reserves.  These actions will often drive away shareholders, forcing the share price down.  History also shows these actions rarely turn things around, and are usually just delaying the inevitable. (To those of you who know about REITs, keep reading, they will be addressed further down.

***#3. Check the balance sheet:***  High levels of debt represent a competing use of cash.  Under most global securities laws, a company must pay its creditors before it pays its dividends.  A fast-rising level of debt could indicate bankruptcy in the short or medium-term future.  Under US and EU bankruptcy law, corporations in the bankruptcy process are (depending on the circumstances) legally barred from paying dividends to shareholders.  Corporations with high debt levels may also look to the courts to assist in reorganizing debts without declaring bankruptcy.  Oftentimes, judges in these cases will force reductions or suspensions in dividend payments to prioritize the repayment of creditors.

***#4. Look for dividend growth:*** Generally speaking, you want to find companies that not only pay steady dividends, but also increase them at regular intervals (i.e. once per year over the past three, five, or even 10 years.  **Research has also shown that companies that grow their dividends tend to outperform their peers over time.^([2])**  Not only that, but a strong history of regular dividend growth also helps keep pace with inflation, which is particularly valuable to those who wish to seek financial independence and live off of their investments.

With that being said, just because a company did not increase their dividends in 2020 or 2021 does not make it necessarily worthy of exclusion from your portfolio.  Certain industries (like the top US banks) were legally prohibited by the federal government from raising their dividends during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Most companies have been hoarding cash to help weather the economic uncertainty, so it is not unreasonable to for them to keep dividends stagnant until the economy bounces back.  When it comes to companies impacted by the pandemic, look for other factors aside from dividend changes to determine whether or not the company is worth your investment.

***#5. Understand sector risk:***  Some sectors offer a more attractive combination of dividends and growth than others, but they also offer different risk characteristics that you should consider when researching dividend payers for your portfolio.  Stocks from the banking, consumer staples, and utilities sectors, for example, are known for steady dividends and lower volatility, but they also tend to offer less growth potential (though this varies from company to company).  Dividend paying tech companies, on the other hand, could offer attractive dividends along with the opportunity for larger price gains, but they also tend to be much more volatile.  If you are a long-term investor, you might be willing to accept tech's higher volatility in exchange for its growth and income prospects, but if you are nearing or in retirement, you might want to prioritize dividend-payers from less volatile industries.

***#6.  Consider a fund:***  If you are worried the potential for price declines eroding the value of your dividend stocks, consider instead a dividend-focused exchange traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund.  Such funds typically hold stocks that have a history of distributing dividends to their shareholders, and they provide a greater level of diversification than you can achieve by buying a handful of dividend paying stocks.  Funds are typically preferred by those who wish to take a more hands-off approach to their investments.  These will be your best option if you lack the time or inclination to conduct in-depth research of companies.

**Part III: Ideal age of the dividend investor.**

Oftentimes inexperienced investors will claim dividends are for those at or nearing retirement.  As was demonstrated earlier in this piece, nothing could be further from the truth. No matter what stage of your life or investing career, dividend-paying stocks can be a great way to supplement or even replace your income and improve your portfolio's growth potential.  Just be sure you research their overall financial health, not just their dividend rates, before investing.  There is no such thing as a right or wrong decision, as long as you achieve your desired outcome.

**Part IV: When not to reinvest**

Part I demonstrated how powerful reinvesting one's dividends can be, but there are certain circumstances where it can be more financially savvy to refrain from reinvesting your dividends.  Below are three situations in which you might want to deploy dividend payouts elsewhere.

* **You are in or near retirement:** When you are living off your savings, taking income from your dividends allows you to let more of your portfolio stay invested for growth.  If you are nearing retirement, on the other hand, you can use the payouts to build up your cash and short-term reserves as you prepare for the transition to life after work.  Some dividend investors have even built their portfolios to have their dividends cover 100% of their expenses.
* **Your portfolio is out of balance:**  Reinvesting the dividends of a well-performing investment back into that investment can throw your portfolio off balance over time.  In such cases, you might want to take the cash and reinvest it elsewhere.
* **The investment is underperforming:**  If you are worried about an investment's future prospects but are not quite ready to let it go, you may not want to reinvest the payouts back into that investment.  Instead, you might use the dividends to dip your toe into something prospective that could ultimately replace the underperforming investment.

**Part V: Understanding Taxes on your portfolio**

The question of taxes often comes up a lot in investing communities, and r/dividends is no exception.  However, we mods prohibit direct questions regarding taxes and other questions of legality because nobody here is a licensed tax professional in every single tax jurisdiction on Earth.  The question of taxes varies so wildly between regions that even making basic generalizations borders on pointless.  The only constant is that you will pay taxes at some point in your life on your investments.  Whether it is before you make your gains, after you make your gains, or somewhere in between, you will pay taxes.  The different types of accounts and options available to you varies based on your income, geography, employer, and dozens of other factors.  Some countries offer special accounts for those who serve in the military, law enforcement, or some other specialized profession(s).  Some trade unions help pay the taxes you may owe on certain investment types.  The variations on the tax question are so all over the place that I could break Reddit's character limit just covering the most general details.

Typically the best resource for understanding your local tax situation is the government agenc(ies) responsible for collecting your money.  As of 2021, most all have websites of various levels of usability.  They should often be your first stop for most questions.  When in doubt, always talk to a professional.

**Part VI: Special Snowflake companies (REITS, MLPs, royalty trusts, etc.)**

Some companies do not fit neatly into the category of an S-class corporation, and see themselves as special snowflakes worthy of a special tax status.  Understanding these entities is a critical prerequisite to holding them in your portfolio, as many may require additional tax paperwork.  In my personal experience, aside from REITS, most are not worth the time of the average investor.  Unless you already have a preexisting knowledge of how these companies work, I would not go out of your way to understand in-depth how they operate when there are so many options out there that could provide better returns.

The only exception to this rule is the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).  Unlike other special snowflake investments, REITs are relatively self explanatory.  They deal 100% in real estate.  Nothing else.  REITs are favored by dividend investors because of their special arrangement with the US government.  In exchange for not having to pay most federal corporate taxes, REITs are legally required to pass on at minimum 90% of their profits under GAAP to shareholders in the form of dividends, which are taxed as income by the US government.  The keyword here is GAAP.

Most places on Earth (aka the United States and almost nobody else) requires the usage of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (or GAAP standard of accounting).  GAAP is incredibly strict, intricate, complicated, and almost impossible to cheat.  100% of publicly traded companies in the US use GAAP, which makes comparing the finances of US stocks incredibly easy.  However, the tax structure of Real Estate Investment trusts often causes the math behind GAAP (or any other accounting system for that matter) to break down.  This can make REIT payout ratios look absolutely insane in relation to other companies, and can make most REITs look incredibly unprofitable.  To combat this, REITs have developed their own standards utilizing simplified math, called the funds from operations (FFO) metrics.  I originally had a more in-depth explanation of this concept (as well as information about BDCs, MLPs, and Royalty Trusts), but I had to cut it out of the final draft of this post because Reddit has a 40,000 character limit.  The best I can do right now is to point you in the direction of Investopedia, which has an [excellent article on the subject of FFOs, linked here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsfromoperation.asp).

The decision of whether or not to incorporate these types of investments into your portfolio is a personal one, and just like with any other type of investment, varies greatly based on your risk tolerance and portfolio goals.

**Part VII: Performing in-depth research on companies**

While anyone can read a balance sheet synopsis on Seeking Alpha and vaguely grasp its meaning, above understanding a concept is the ability to put one's knowledge into practice.  The reason I put this skill above actually picking companies is because stock picking can be done with a relatively low knowledge base, but actually digging deep into financial statements and balance sheets to discover companies on your own not on the traditional press circuit can serve as the true test of someone's research potential.

Oftentimes I come across even experienced investors unaware of just how many resources are available to them on this front.  While websites, apps, and YouTube channels exist all over the place, an often underutilized resource for investment knowledge is the companies themselves.  99% of publicly traded companies have a website dedicated to serving the needs of investors, often with email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses just begging to be contacted.  How much did Coca-Cola pay in dividends in 1926?  Google doesn't know (I checked), but I guarantee you somewhere in an Atlanta filing cabinet lies Coke's dividend history from back in that time.  It is obscure, seemingly random knowledge like that investor relations experts are paid to answer.

\[Side note: originally, there was going to be a far larger expanded section about this, but it was cut for the sake of conforming to Reddit's character limit.\]

**Part VIII: Diminishing returns and micromanagement**

By paying attention in school, you may have been informed regarding the law of diminishing returns.  When it comes to dividend investing (or any type of investing), the law of diminishing returns can play a big part of your portfolio management.  While you should always be on the lookout for investment opportunities, if day trading is the reason you wake up in the morning, dividend investing may not be right for you.  Strategies like buying right before the ex-div date and selling immediately afterwards rarely turn out in your favor, and even when they do are often not worth the trouble. Your gain will be a few cents at best, or worse you lose money.  In my experience as the lead moderator of this subreddit, monitoring comments, I can say with confidence that most people **will** lose money on this day-trading type strategy.  Most of the price action regarding a dividend took place days or weeks before the ex-dividend date, spread out over a period of time.  Companies often issue dividends on a clockwork schedule according to the [ISO Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date), so institutional investors are often able to predict when the dividend will be paid months or even years in advance, long before the boards of these companies officially announce their dividends.

A similar thing can be said for those attempting to buy stocks at the absolute lowest possible price.  I have seen individuals hold out for days waiting for a few extra cents.  If you have a six figure portfolio, you do not need to be trying to time a 12 cent price drop.  Your time will be better spent elsewhere.  Understanding the law of diminishing returns can sometimes singlehandedly turn an underperforming portfolio into an overperforming one.  By taking a hands off approach to most of your investments, you let the market work in the background of your life.  As the old saying goes, ""time in the market beats timing the market every day of the week.""

**Part IX: Debt and financing your investments**

Early in your investment journey, the idea of purchasing dividend stocks on debt sounds like a great idea.  Buy the stocks, use the dividends to pay off the loan, then keep the stocks and profit.  It sounds foolproof right up until it isn't.  What seems like free money is more akin to an advance on a sh\*\*\*y record deal.  If you decide to take out a $50,000 loan to buy dividend stocks, don't be surprised if acquiring a home or auto loan becomes significantly more difficult or downright impossible depending on your circumstances.  Banks and credit unions are often far more hesitant to lend out money to those with high amounts of preexisting debt.  When these loans are given however, they often come with interest rates higher than what you would have normally had to pay if you had not decided to buy a bunch of AT&T with a personal loan.  Any amount below $20,000 will hardly have a significant effect on your long-term portfolio (assuming you are still investing with earned income), and any amount above $20,000 could have serious ramifications on your ability to access credit in the event you truly need it.  If you fail to disclose this preexisting loan to any prospective lender, then congratulations, you have just committed fraud, which is something we do not condone here on r/dividends.

Your income and lifestyle should be sufficient to fund your investment needs.  While I understand the frustration that can come with being a student with 0 disposable income, being a student is actually the best possible reason **not** to have a five-figure unsecured debt load.  As someone with a degree in Management and a career in the field, I can tell you that many employers conduct background and credit checks on prospective employees (though credit checks on employees are illegal in certain states).  A $20,000 personal loan made by a 20 year old raises a lot of red flags, and while it could signal personal illness or medical debt, it could signal a gambling problem.  When you tell them you used the money to buy stocks, they will immediately assume gambling problem.  Good things come to those who wait.

**Part X: Brokerages and celebrity portfolios**

If you came to this post or subreddit looking for nothing but a brokerage recommendation, I recommend you look elsewhere.  While my wife and I personally use M1 Finance, and I do recommend it to friends and family, I have no idea who is reading this post.  I know only what information Reddit gives me as a moderator, so I will say that for the love of whatever you believe in do not choose a brokerage just because some internet personality, or some random person on Reddit told you about it.  Brokerages are not interchangeable, and they offer wildly different features and benefits. I like M1 because of the ability to form pies.  [This for example is my personal portfolio](https://m1.finance/qhxHMPtymDjd).  I enjoy what I enjoy about M1, and what it is able to offer me and my family.  Your situation is (likely) different.  This is also the reason we explicitly ban referral links on r/dividends.  The only recommendation I will issue is do not invest with Robinhood.  Other than that, go nuts.

**Part XI: Beyond dividends, and knowing when not to invest.**

Equally important to the skills of investing are the skills of knowing when not to invest.  If you have credit card debt, pay that off first, and make sure to pay 100% of your balance every month.  If you do not have an emergency fund, create one.  It should consist of roughly six months worth of expenses.  If you lack a financial plan or budget, create one.  My wife and I use [Mint.com](https://Mint.com) for our budget.  We sync it with our cards, and everything comes out perfectly.  I highly recommend it.

**Part XII: Seeking feedback**

Saving and investing can become an addiction, so it is important to know when to moderate it.  Having a third party provide additional input or opinions on your decisions can work wonders.  If you have a significant other or a best friend, I would recommend getting them into the investing mindset, if they are not already.  Having a trusted voice to bounce ideas off can lead to not only financial reward, but emotional and intellectual growth.

Since I took over this subreddit in August 2020, I have strived to create that environment here.  It is from this base framework that I am hoping future discussions in this community can branch from.  If you are just joining us, or have been with this community for years, I thank you for joining us on r/dividends.

Happy investing,

dividends,"It’s good that you’re self-aware about your portfolio structure — over-diversification can sometimes dilute your returns and make it hard to manage or track progress.

Before selling at a loss, consider these steps:

**1. Evaluate overlap:**  
First, check how much overlap exists between your current holdings and the funds you want to consolidate into (like VOO, SCHD, SCHG). You might already have exposure to the same companies through multiple ETFs or stocks.

**2. Focus on core holdings:**  
Funds like **VOO** (S&P 500), **SCHD** (dividend growth), and **SCHG** (growth tilt) are excellent long-term anchors. You could slowly DCA into these while letting smaller, less meaningful positions fade unless they bounce back.

**3. Tax-loss harvesting:**  
If you’re sitting on some red positions, use tax-loss harvesting wisely to offset future gains. But don’t just sell because something’s down — ask if it still aligns with your goals.

**4. Age & goals matter:**  
At 34, you still have time on your side. Focus on building a well-balanced core of quality funds/stocks and simplify your portfolio gradually — no need to rush it all at once, especially in a volatile market.

**5. Other suggestions:**  
If you’re dividend-focused, SCHD is hard to beat. Add **VTI** or **VXUS** if you want total market or international exposure. For growth, **QQQ** or **XLK** might complement SCHG.

The results are truly enlightening and amazing. The results are based on U.S. data from the start of 1926 through October 14, 2023. The data source (other than for Gold) is a well-known reference book called “Stocks, Bonds, Bills and Inflation” 2022 edition. The book is published annually and is available through Wiley. The figures for 2023 were added from other sources as of October 14.

>Note that most analysis of historic returns that you have seen is often flawed in that it is based on “nominal” returns before inflation. **The graphs and figures below are based on “real” returns after inflation. That is, this analysis shows the real increase in actual purchasing power generated by each investment asset class** – and the decrease in the purchasing power of cash.

>The first graph below shows the long-term real (after inflation) returns on large capital U.S. stocks (The S&P 500 index of stocks), long term U.S. Treasury bonds (20 years), U.S. Treasury Bills (30-day cash investments), the real value of a U.S. dollar after inflation and Gold. The return is illustrated by showing the inflation-adjusted growth over the years of each $1.00 invested in each asset at the end of 1925.

>[https://www.investorsfriend.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/26-23-real.jpg](https://www.investorsfriend.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/26-23-real.jpg)

>Isn’t that amazing? **In real-dollar terms (adjusted for inflation), large U.S. stocks have absolutely clobbered long-term government bonds,** short-term cash investments, Gold, and the dollar itself in terms of total growth or return. There is just no comparison! Each dollar invested in large stocks at the end of 1925 was worth $749 in real (inflation-adjusted) purchasing power 98 years later at October 14, 2023. Yes, that is an increase of 749 times the real spending power after inflation!. An astounding gain of 74,800% even after accounting for inflation!

>**This amazing out-performance of stocks (which beat long-term government bonds by a factor of $749/$7.03 or a staggering 107 to 1, in the 98 years) has occurred in spite of the two huge stock crashes that have occurred since the year 2000, not to mention the stock crash of the great depression.** The S&P 500 stocks also clobbered Gold by a factor of $749/$5.35 or a withering 140 to 1.

Let's make up a stock - $UBST. This stock sells for $100, and has an ironclad yearly $5 dividend. If you buy 10 shares, you get $50 at the end of the year. If you have dividend reinvestment set up, you have $1050 at the end of the year.

But, let's say that stock value drops 10%, like the stock market is wont to do right now.

Suddenly, at the end of the year your 10 shares of $UBST is only worth $900. Or, $950 with DRIP. Now, to recoup your losses, you have to stay invested for at least 2 years.  All the while your account is in the red, and assuming no further price movement.

As of right now, the S&P 500 is down \~11% since last week. No one knows if it'll settle out, or a new bonkers announcement will come out. We could be coming down off of the highest heights we see in 20 years. We could just be hitting a speedbump.

SCHD is down 13% - if you think the market is going to rebound, that means it's at a sweet discount. If you think we have farther to fall, then you'd be losing money. Sorry for the less than concise answer. But shit's cray right now. No one knows which way the market will fall.

All told, I wish i'd started investing earlier. Turns out that 10 years can really make a difference. If you want to pick some dividend stocks & yeet a grand at it, have at it. Just be aware that we're in a volatile time right now, and you might see a beefy loss. You're 21, so it doesn't really matter, compared to someone who's 65 and about to retire. You have the time to spare.

Were I in your shoes, i'd pick 10 stocks, and invest $100 in each. Do actual research on them. Google the terms you don't know. Read an investopedia article or three. Write down why you want each stock, and what you think the risks & upsides are to each. Then, see how you do. Make it a competition with friends if you wanna.

Just...don't invest anything you can't lose, ok?

dividends,"I don’t have a ROTH IRA but I’m familiar with them. I’m sure you know this but you can’t touch it until retirement age. They are very good though and I anticipate opening one soon. If you want easy access to your money just open a brokerage account. 

I use Think or Swim(TOS) with Charles Schwab and Robinhood. TOS is superior but it has a very outdated UI where Robinhood is still a good choice and it’s much much more easier to pick up and understand. I only use Robinhood for ETFs as you can buy fractional shares of everything with them but not TOS. I also trust TOS more because Schwab is an actual bank but that’s just me. 

Anytime I see red I say it’s a good time. The only issue is that we don’t know how low this can possibly go so look into the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging. In the end, investing today will certainly not hurt you in the future. 

For ETFS I buy SCHG, VOO, and QQQ. VOO is more conservative as it’s a much more diversified ETF where SCHG and QQQ are more growth aggressive but also more volatile due to how tech heavy they are. As for stocks I tend to focus more into tech. Specifically AAPL, AMZN, PLTR, NVDA, AMD, etc. outside of tech, I really like SOFI(kinda tech) and NKE. In the end, build a foundation with ETFS and good credible companies that you know will be around and innovating for decades to come. 

My advice might be aggressive but we’re both in our early twenties and I started investing at 20 years at the bottom of the Covid crash and it’s done a lot for me. Advice would be different if you were closer to retirement age.

dividends,"First, find a good rate. I use Robinhood. I use them more and more because the benefits are good. I also have schwab but their rates are 2x as much! And include more stipulations... They really need to get their act together. Anyhoo, RH has a maximum rate of 5.75% on margin used. More margin equals less interest. But this rate applies to the majority of us. You can have, for ex. 20k margin but if you don't use it, no interest. RH also has first 1k margin used interest free. I am not a RH rep! Just my experience. I still like some features Schwab has that RH does not, yet. BTW, I subscribed to RH Gold for $50/yr. Imo, worth it. I don't know about any other brockerages. If you can find something better, go for it.
*Don't buy a boat load of stocks but doesn't pay a dividend until after your margin interest is due.*
Apply for a margin account through your preferred broker. A good rule of thumb is to limit your margin. Out of fear of margin calls and inexperience, I would start small... 10%.Then work up to 50% or more as you learn and get a feel for it. You need to make more than the margin interest each month and have it available for the broker. RH has it right on their margin page of your account. 
Buy shares of w/e with your margin that has maybe 10-12% yield and it's hard to lose. Half goes to broker, half to you, you keep the shares. Repeat! You can buy with cash, too. However, the broker will always use your cash first. So, some balancing act there. Either buy more shares or take out the difference after broker takes their interest. 
But yeah, managing the margin for downside is the most impactful and potentially dangerous thing. Don't use it all. You need to keep a healthy buffer in case of crashes. The more volatile the stock, the more margin maintenance. RH also does a good job showing you and warning you when you may be adding more risk. I would just stick to as dependable  stocks as possible with an average above the margin interest. 
It's not really difficult at all just a little scary because of the potential pitfalls if you are not careful. Just make sure the interest balance is covered by the due date each month. Like a bill. The dividends should more than cover. Read up on margin and whatnot so you get a complete understanding. There are youtube videos, too.

On March 21, the fund nearly doubled its energy-stock exposure to 21% from 12%; its largest holding is ConocoPhillips at 4.7%. The move was part of an annual “reconstitution,” meant to keep its portfolio on target with its investment objectives.  
The big change in the Schwab dividend ETF's March 21 re-constitution was the boost in energy stocks.  
Energy stocks are off 7.4% this year after the selloff, beating the S&P 500’s 13.5% fall. But with shares closely tied to commodity prices, they can be risky. A State Street Global Advisors study found energy to have the highest five-year volatility of any sector. Meanwhile, oil prices are down, OPEC may lift production, and steel tariffs are adding to costs.  
CFRA analyst Aniket Ullal says there’s nothing inherently wrong with the approach, but risk-averse investors might opt for funds such as the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF or the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF, which focus on companies that have raised dividends rather than those with the highest yields; energy is less than 6% at both.

Dividend Yields & Per-Share Payouts:
SCHW — ~1.6% yield | ~$1.00 per share annually

META — ~0.4% (new in 2024) | ~$2.00

GOOGL — ~0.15% (just started paying) | ~$0.80
NVDA — ~0.03% | ~$0.16
AMZN & TSLA — No dividend
Takeaway:
MSFT and META beat SCHW on per-share dividend amounts.
SCHW offers a higher yield, but that’s partially due to the lower stock price.
For long-term growth, the Mag 7 dominate, but if you’re looking to balance growth + income, Schwab and dividend-paying tech like MSFT, META, AAPL could work together well.

It's because I don't look at y/y growth, it's not even a factor in my investment strategy for individual stocks. 

> buying Schwab

Because I actually like the product and products they offer. First major firm to go to zero commission trading, fantastic consumer service, some of the best investment products(schg/schd), I see in real time the innovation and changes and improvement in the product. 

I own the stock as I want to own the company, I'm not buying for y/y growth, I'm buying this position to hold for decades. How the company is run ""should"" give it an advantage vs it's competitors,and even if it doesn't I'm fine with owning a company I like. I'm not min/maxing returns or trying to generate alpha. 

> even paying higher dividends per share compared to Schwab

Useless information, dividend yield and dividend growth are the stats that matter.

dividends,"Fellow Canadian here.... hard to say what is a ""discount"" at the moment because that is all relatively to a company's earnings potential, and since we are in the midst of one of the wildest global economic growth shocks in a while, it's hard to say what it will do to earnings and thus to asset prices.

But I can confirm what I'm nibbling on at the moment:

\- TD: solid business, more international exposure, dividend over 5%.  Closed their sale of Charles Schwab at the perfect time and that money was all allocated to share buybacks, which I'm hoping puts a floor underneath the stock at some point and helps with earnings per share/dividends.  Pretty much any of the banks look ok at the moment for dipping your toe in the water if the hold is long term (though I'm personally underinvesting in National Bank and BMO at the moment)

\- OpenText: bit of a low-key one, but it popped up on my screener on Thursday and seems interesting.  Dividend now north of 4% which is something for a tech business, fairly sticky customers, stock way off its 52 week high, also has a sizeable share buyback program in place already

\- Suncor: oil prices have been hammered, rightfully so on a global economic slowdown and trade war, but they will eventually recover and Suncor should be in a good spot.  Was trading at a ludicrous P/FCF of 6 (six!) though as mentioned earnings will be hit.  Dividend is nearing 5% as well, which again should help with a price floor at some stage

\- Cenovus Energy: similar story to Suncor.  Still a monster business ($20B market cap), dividend nearing 5%, P/FCF is under 7.  Long term and short term debt are under control and, if you think interest rates will keep dropping, this could be further helped.  30% insider ownership to boot should help reduce the selling out there

\- Manulife/Sun Life: similar to the banks, just the insurance/group benefits version of the story.  Good dividends, relatively strong businesses, you know the drill.  Again, not making huge purchases here but starting to accumulate a little bit when they drop materially

Anyways, that gives you a bit of an idea.  I'm biasing towards larger, well-established, well-capitalized companies with a history of riding out storms, good balance sheets, strong track record of dividends, and (ideally) share repurchase programs already in place or likely to be put in place with this sell off.

dividends,"I like PULS for my emergency money.  It holds high rated ultrashort term corporate bonds. Pays dividends monthly, so you can set it to reinvest and it compounds. About 5.5% annual returns.

The price only fluctuates less than a dollar depending on when the dividend is paid.  Sells immediately (I think only when the market is open, including extended hours).

You could open a Schwab brokerage account tied to a checking account and get a debit card.  You don’t want to keep cash in the cash account section of the brokerage account, because it doesn’t pay interest.

But as soon as you sell some PULS, it goes immediately into the cash account and you can use the debit card. You can do all this easily in the phone app.

I disagree about growth stocks. They are volatile, which we are seeing right now.  Nothing wrong with some decent dividend stocks that will also probably grow and pay you to hold them.

Taxes on the dividends probably won’t be a big deal for you at your income level and tax write offs with your kids, etc.  Especially, if you buy them in your IRA.

As far as your house, if you’re paying PMI (private mortgage insurance), I suggest you pay down enough on your mortgage to get whatever percentage of equity your mortgage lender requires to be able to get rid of the PMI.  

If your down payment was low, they may be adding PMI to your payment. It’s expensive.  So I would definitely work on that. If you don’t know, call your lender to find out if you’re paying PMI and how much you need to pay down your mortgage to get rid of it.

dividends,"In terms of dividend stocks, SCHD currently looks very, very appealing. After the recent selloff it’s now yielding more than 4%. (I think 4.11%) the only other period it ever got this high was during the 2020 crash. It tapped out at nearly 4.40% yield. But only stayed that way briefly. And SCHD on average increases its dividends by 11% annually. It’s excellent for dividends and stabile growth. But it’s not exactly going to be a booming ETF. Capital appreciation will be more muted. And it’ll typically always underperform long term. VYM and VIG are options also. But I much prefer SCHD. 

S&P 500 ETF’s can also be quite solid. Few people can outpace it. Stuff like VOO or SPLG can be very nice considerations. You can’t really go wrong with the S&P 500 low cost ETF’s. They lack for dividend yield. But capital appreciation makes up for it. VT/VTI can be options as well. VT is total world. (Yet mostly American) VTI is total USA. 

Then you have more aggressive ETF’s like SCHG, QQQ/QQQM, and VGT. They have minimal dividends. But can have very strong appreciation/growth. But also can bust hard during down periods like now. These ones have gotten torched much harder lately. But have still done better overall in terms of the longer term. I personally prefer SCHG out of the three. These are pretty megacap and tech heavy. Each one is a bit different in terms of holdings and methodology, though. 

A good mix of the three above can be pretty smart. The top is usually lower risk, slower growth and dividend focused. The middle is a combo of good growth and okay dividends. The bottom is quite low for dividends but really appreciate and boom harder. If you’re in it for a long time the middle and bottom should be a higher focus. But I still think a good bit of exposure to stuff like SCHD can be useful. 

Another thing to consider is if you want exposure to international stuff. VT is Majnly focused on America. But has a good chunk of exposure elsewhere and is weighted accordingly. If America slips other countries will gain more exposure. But there’s plenty of other international/emerging markets ETF’s out there. Could be worth a bit of exposure depending.

dividends,"No worries. Like I said, it boils down to risk tolerance. If you have a long time frame more aggressive stuff can be more beneficial. But I still think the more boring dividend stuff can serve some purpose. I wouldn’t take this as gospel, but something like 40% VOO/VTI (or anything very comparable)  - 30% SCHG/VGT/QQQM - and 30% SCHD (or other dividend focused ETF) would be pretty sensible. A lower -moderate - higher risk split of sorts. Maybe add in like 10-15% for some international exposure but that’s really up for consideration. 

Or you can simply up the aggressive ETF’s more highly or cut out more dividend oriented funds if you’re willing to chase the higher potential overall gains. Which would favor long term much more theoretically. About 2-4 funds should be about all you really need. Maybe 4 if you choose international. Just be mindful of the choices. Some have a lot of overlap. It wouldn’t make as much sense to have VTI with VOO all that much as an example. Some may say just go all in VOO or another S&P 500 ETF.

dividends,"You will have to use a taxable  this is a taxable account.  So  replace JEPI 7% yield  with SPYI 11% yield(both S%P500 index)  Replace  JEPQ 10% yield  with QQQI  13% (Both NASDAQ 100 index).   The big difference is that SPYI and QQQI take an extra step to reduce your taxes on the dividends you receive.  All these funds hold stock so the NAV will gradually increase with inflation.  Additionally the dividends are all above the long term average of inflation of 3.2%  Inflation will likely be higher So if the dividends are reinvested they will easily keep up with inflation. 

The big issue with SCHD is that you don't get much for the dividend  500k in SCHD would yield 18K a year.  The same 500K in SPYI would produce 55K with similar tax.   What I would rather do is to reinvest a portion of the dividned income from high yield fund into the S SCHD 3.7%% yield  and SCHY 4.1%(international version of SCHD. This would slowly over time deversify your dividend income over time.and would reduce he need for higher dividend funds.  

Other funds I think should PBDC 9% yield.  This is not a covered call fund.  SPYI, QQQI, and JEPI, and JEPQ are all covered call funds.   I prefer to have  fund that income from different investments or different methods.   I also have money invested in SCYB 7% yield from high yield operate bonds.  And PFF  6% from preferred stock and FAGIX 5% yield from coperate and government bond funds.  And I am looking at ARDC a dynamic created fund 12% yield (this is a Closed End Fund.

Keep in mind if one fund should go bad for any reason you could loose a large portion of your income. So you want as many sources of income as you can get with most generating an equal amount of income as possible.  That way if you loose one fund you won't loose all of your income.  For example if you have 10 funds generating an equal amount of income the loose of one would longly cost you 10% of your income.  

You said 5M but you are only using 2 Million for income.  If the other 3 million is invested in goth funds like S&P500 index funds with yields of 1.3% 4 million on in VOO would produce 39K .  But if instead of VOO you used VYM the yield of 2.8% is about 2 times higher than VOO.  VYM is a US dividned fund that covers a large portion of the US market.  VYMI is an identical fund but it invest in international dividned stocks  but with a yield of 4.45%.

dividends,"hi all,

just started out getting into the investments and I would appreciate any feedback you may have. The idea for this dividend portfolio is to live of the income it could theoretically generate over the next 25-30 year with DRIP until I retire (will be in an ROTH IRA). My wife's Roth is focusing on growth. Additionally, we also have individual brokerage accounts which is 65% VOO (or VTI)/ 20% SCHD and 15% SCHG. 

I do understand that some of these have an overlap e.g. QQQI/ SPYI vs JEPQ and JEPI but since NEOS and JPM covered call income ETFs dont have a very long history I though I plan for both and can adjust later if needed.

dividends,"It’s not dividend yield, it’s shareholder yield. If the company pays 5% dividend yield and you buy X number of shares you own X amount of the company. 

If the company doesn’t increase or decrease the amount of shares, dividend yield is shareholder yield.

If the company doesn’t grow or lose value (share price stays the same) your total return is the dividend yield minus inflation.

If the company buys back shares, your share owns a larger percentage of the company as the total number of shares is reduced. This increases your shareholder yield (dividend yield + amount of shares reduced by the company’s purchase).

If the company increases the number of shares, which is what O is doing, your share owns less of the company so your shareholder yield goes down (you control less of the company).

I don’t want to confuse you but you must also look at the role of inflation. If a company doesn’t grow the dividend by more than inflation then your total return is lower due to the lower purchasing power. 

https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/ma/dividend/

Here’s an example of a company that is growing the dividend by greater than inflation while also reducing the number of shares. You can see the impact on the shareholder yield. Also on the total return from the increase to the dividend.

Then take some advice from the 6th richest person in the world:

>Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a long-standing advocate of safe investment options. The majority of his wealth comes from investments in different industries, while his total equity portfolio is valued at a whopping $347 billion.

>Though Buffett’s investment prowess has often been associated with his adept stock-picking skills, his persistent advocacy for index funds sheds light on a simple yet powerful strategy for investors.

>**""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund""**, Buffett had once said. ""The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,"" he further added.

dividends,"When the market delivers uncertainty, investors are given many options on how to react. Some decide to buy companies most impacted by market events and hope for rebounds, while others try to determine which sectors will be least impacted. For the dividend growth investor, these moments present opportunities to refocus on companies with long track records of stability and dividends.  Companies that generate strong profits and consistently return capital to shareholders are likely to persevere in all markets. My monthly Stock of the Month posts attempt to highlight companies with this potential. 

This month’s stock is Oshkosh (OSK). 
Disclosure: I own a small position and presently intend to hold into the future. 
Disclaimer: For educational purposes only. 

Dividend Highlights:
- The current dividend is $0.51 per quarter, translating to an annualized yield of 2.47% at the current stock price of $82.58.

- The average historical yield over the past decade has been 1.52%. Therefore, today’s investor will purchase a cash flow stream 62% more valuable than the 10-year average.

- Oshkosh has been increasing its dividends for a respectable 10 consecutive years.

- I typically aim for a 15% Chowder Ratio with new stock purchases. OSK has a slightly lower Chowder Ratio of just 13.7%, but has a very low payout ratio. This helps provide a margin of safety under volatile business conditions. 

Investment Performance:
- An investor who bought $10,000 worth of OSK on April 6, 2015, and reinvested all dividends would have experienced total returns of 99%, with a current value of $19,924. Unfortunately, this significantly trails a broader market index (like the S&P 500), so there is some risk of lower long-term returns with this stock.

- The 2015 investor initially bought the stock at a yield of 1.39%, expecting $0.68 in their first year. Today, they are set to earn $2.04, resulting in a yield on cost of 4.2%. Patience has certainly paid off!

Future Outlook:
- While the future is uncertain, investing in Oshkosh comes with several potential rewards, including annual dividend increases, price improvements, and high likelihood for ongoing dividends even if tariffs affect profits over the coming years. 

- Annual dividend increases are typically announced in February.  This year's increase was a solid 10.9%.

- There is also opportunity for price improvements. Assuming a lower dividend growth rate of about 8.5% to maintain conservatism in this analysis, if the company returns to its long-term average yield of 1.52% by 2030, today’s investor might have stock worth $202 (244% price return) and earn a yield on cost of 3.72% ($3.07 annually).

- The company’s 20% dividend payout ratio allows the company to pay this projected dividend amount even under a scenario of 60% lower profits over the next 5 years.

For the above reasons, OSK is my choice for Stock of the Month and is well-positioned to continue its long-term creation of shareholder wealth. 

The stock of the month portfolio (three months so far), is down 9.97% in price and has earned 0.60% in dividends for a total return (dividends not reinvested) of -9.37%. This is slightly unfavorable to SCHD’s -8.34% total return over the same time period.

dividends,"I think now is an excellent time to buy SCHD. Valuation is very solid. Dividend yield has now pushed past 4%. Historically I don’t think it’s ever gotten this high for yield. Maybe pretty close to the Covid lows. Right now seems like a compelling opportunity for that. Hard to say if it’s over. It may slip some more. But overall it’s in a very great spot after this market downfall. 

But I’d suggest a good mix of higher growth stuff also. Some sort of good mix/split. The S&P, Nasdaq stuff like QQQ/QQQM. Maybe stuff like SCHG or VGT. It’ll be more volatile. And may have more shorter term risk. But capital appreciation can really be very beneficial down the road. 

SCHD I feel is more compelling currently. But other growth ETF’s are looking pretty good now also. It’s always best to have a good mix. How you allocate it is up to you.

As for capital appreciation, they will follow inline with the positions they hold.  JEPI uses the S&P 500 while JEPQ uses the Nasdaq 100.  JEPQ is more tech-oriented like the Nasdaq 100.

Oh, and the fact it holds positions in the underlying is also why you don’t see the crazy NAV erosion that you see with other such funds - like those coming out of yield max, for instance.

I’ve recently started a Charles Schwab Roth IRA in the hopes of investing in ETFs that would provide enough interest income to retire later on in life.  My basic understanding is that over time and consistent monthly investing the interest from an index fund or ETF that tracks the S&P 500 will generate enough interest over time to supplement your retirement. However I just learned that some ETFs pay out dividends as well so I’m interested in building a portfolio that can provide financial stability for retirement as well as one that will eventually provide me monthly/yearly income like the ones I see on here. Is it possible to build a retirement portfolio and an active/current  income one at the same time? Is a Charles Schwab account the right account for both of these goals?

It is.

>Have no clear goals but I’d like to retire early from work burnout.

You'll need to grow your portfolio. At least 2x but 3x or 4x would be better. The more money you have the sooner you will be able to retire and the more income you will eventually be able to generate. Your focus should be on growing your portfolio at this time, not on generating dividends. Your focus will turn to dividend production after you have grown your portfolio much bigger. This is the time in your life to do that.

>How would you restructure all this? 

You have a lot of redundancy and overlap. If you streamlined your portfolio it would be easier to manage, be less confusing , and you would have a clearer picture of what you have. I hope this is in an IRA so there are no tax consequences to selling some of the things you have.

VOO and SPY are exactly the same thing, S&P 500 index funds. You don't need both. Your SPY is smaller than VOO so sell SPY and put the money into VOO.

FZROX is a ""total"" US stock fund, that overlaps around 86% with VOO and SPY. Their performance is similar with a slight edge to VOO.

https://totalrealreturns.com/n/FZROX,VOO

You don't need VOO/SPY and FZROX too. Since VOO has slightly outperformed FZROX I would sell FZROX and put the money into VOO.

All of your individual stocks are in VOO *and* SPY *and* FZROX, so you are just doubling up on things that are already in the funds. Having most of your money in funds and having individual stocks that are also in the funds kind of defeats the purpose of the individual stocks. Individual stocks are great if you like stock picking over investing in funds, or if you want to own stocks that aren't in your funds. I would sell your individual stocks and put the money into VOO, maybe keeping one or two if you really love them.

FZFXX and SPAXX are very similar US government/Treasury money market funds. Their yields are almost the same so consolidate into one of them. 

FXNAX is a US bond fund. That's the Boglehead influence. You don't need bonds at 36 years old. Bonds aren't going to grow your portfolio.

That concept that it is easier for something small to double than for something gigantic like AAPL or MSFT to double applies to companies and their stocks, but not to funds. A fund is a collection of stocks or other assets. The performance of the fund is a function of its portfolio and the assets it holds, not the size of the fund (Assets Under Management or AUM) or how long it has been around.

dividends,"Hi,

23 year old here new to dividend investing and stocks in general. Planning to start with £1000 then £400 a month after. As someone in my position, would you recommend investing in individual stocks such as JPM, BATs, BLK etc. Or would you recommend investing in ETFs such as VOO, SPYD etc. 

I feel like since I don't have a lot to invest with I should be going for a higher yield so I can reinvest what little dividends I receive. I have been looking at stats on [dividendstocks.com](http://dividendstocks.com) to find company yields in US and UK markets. My understanding is that I shouldn't be looking at stocks with yield at higher than 6% and I assume the payout ratio should be less than 100% and years of dividend growth should be at least 10 years.

Any general advice or specific investment advice would be appreciated.

My idea is to allocate the following:
- 10% on a Nancy Pelosi tracking portfolio
- 10% on a European defense stock portfolio
- 10% on a ""defensive"" portfolio (20% XAD1, 20% VWCE, 20% DTLA, 20% IUSN, 20% CSBGE7) basically 20% gold, 40% stocks and 40% bonds.
- 70% in a dividend growth portfolio.

I was mainly looking at allocating 50% in JEPI, JEPQ, JEPG since JPM has opened a EU version, for the remaining 50% I was looking at SPYW, ZPRG, SCHD and a small 5ish% into VNQ.

The problem is, that being located in the EU, if I understood correctly, the US keep 15% of my dividends and I also get taxed 26% (normal capital gain tax) by Italy. This is very inefficient and I am thus looking for EU alternatives to SCHD and VNQ. Also, let me know what you think of my portfolio idea and if I should lose the ""defensive"" portfolio.

dividends,"Hi, I’m 24 years old and recently had the idea of buying 400 shares of SCHD in my Roth IRA (at the current price, that’s roughly $11,000). These 400 shares would generate about $400 annually in dividends.

My plan is to let it grow for 40 years while reinvesting the dividends back into the stock, taking advantage of tax-free compound growth until I can withdraw it. Essentially, letting it snowball over time.

dividends,"Hey all, looking for some help and advice as I start up a Roth IRA before this tax year ends. Quick details below:  
  
43 yrs old with a goal to retire between 60-62 yrs old.  
I have a 401k but I only started seriously saving at my company match limit of 6% about 8 yrs ago.  
  
401k Breakdown:  
S&P 500 Tracking Index Fund (50%)  
Russell 2000 Tracking Index Fund (20%)  
MSCI EAFE Tracking Index Fund (20%)  
Bonds & REITS (10%) (Alternate these might go 5/5%)  

I don’t want to put over the company match percentage as the options are limited on what I can invest into with the 401k. I want to invest any extra funds specifically into dividend yielding stocks/ETFs and take advantage of the Roth IRA (I will likely have to back door Roth if that matters) for tax purposes and reinvest the dividends until retirement and then use them as supplemental income along with social security and the 401k.  
  
What would you invest in for this purpose? I’ve heard a lot of buzz tickers like SCHD, JEPI, JEPQ and many others. It seems some are greater short term like JEPI and JEPQ though admittedly I don’t understand why. When I plug those into DRIP calculator’s the annual dividend is pretty high compared to some others but I don’t want to start off strong and long term that not be the case when I really need that in the retirement years.
  
TLDR: In short I just want to build a solid dividend yielding Roth IRA I can start taking the dividends from in about 16rys. What’s realistic at max contributions for that time frame? $1,000-$2,000 per month? What picks you recommend?

Yes. I started investing with $0 when I was over 30, added money for less than 10 years, and became a millionaire by investing in the S&P 500 index for most of the time and then individual growth stocks during the past 8 years.

>it seems I should have started at 20

Yes, the earlier you start, the better, but it's not too late. You'll just have to contribute more than you would have if you had started earlier. No one taught me anything about investing until I was in my 30s. I made sure my children opened Roth IRAs when they were 18 years old and had jobs. I manage their accounts for them and give them money to add to their accounts so they will do better than I did.

>If I put that extra money into dividends will I be able to retire off that at a decent age? Or should I be looking for more aggressive investments? 

Since you are starting a little later you should be as aggressive as your risk tolerance will allow. You should focus on the **total return** of your investments, which is the combination of capital appreciation (increasing share price) plus dividend yield, not just dividend yield.

>If you only care about identifying which stocks have performed better over a period of time, the total return is more important than the dividend yield. If you are relying on your investments to provide consistent income, the dividend yield is more important. **If you have a long-term investment horizon and plan on holding a portfolio for a long time, it makes more sense to focus on total return.**

dividends,"If you’re in the US, and you do not plan on needing the money or dividends for a long time- go ahead and set up a Roth IRA account. For dividends, they can be a tax drag where you will lose money to capital gains, state taxes, and sometimes it’ll be treated like income- so it’ll be charged at income tax rate instead. In a Roth IRA, you won’t have to worry about the tax hit, but it is a retirement account. 


Selling stocks and receiving dividends can have different tax implications depending on how long you hold them, and how long you had them before you received the first dividend. There are even different classifications for dividends, such as being qualified or nonqualified. They get taxed different too. 


Come tax time, you’ll have to fill out a bit more than the W-2 section, and that’s okay. Just have some additional money in your bank account just in case to cover your bases. If your parents invest, they can help you navigate taxes and tell you about their own experiences with investing. 


As far as finding good dividend paying stocks, it’s easier to start with what you know like you are doing. You see that Pepsi and Coke are popular things to consume, you see steady sales. You see a brand that people trust. You also see a brand that does a lot of marketing, has good brand recognition, and they seem to come out with new products or acquisitions every so often. So they aren’t stagnant. 


Businesses can have a lot of ups and downs. They can have recalls, lawsuits, marketing snafus, or just a PR nightmare. It’s good to diversify so that if one company is getting a lot of bad headlines or they start becoming mismanaged or irrelevant- you aren’t left with a sinking ship. 


A lot of investors these days like to go with ETFs. With an ETF you aren’t owning shares in a company, but you are owning a fund that selects a handful to thousands of companies to track. You can google “dividend paying ETFs” and see things like SCHD from Schwab. 


You’ll see US based dividend paying ETFs and international ones. You’ll see some just cover a singular country or region too. ETFs and Mutual Funds go through their portfolio every so often to make sure that bad performers get moved down or are moved off the list. If a company no longer meets their criteria, they deal with it. You aren’t having to sweat bullets if TSLA tanks, because it wasn’t 100% of your portfolio or the ETF’s portfolio. 


Some stocks will absolutely outperform an ETF in the amount of upswing they can have in price point on their shares or in dividend payouts. For those stocks you find, you just have to babysit them to make sure that if they turn into duds, you get out in time. Stocks go up and down all the time, you just have to suss out when a bounce back isn’t likely. Like right now, no one is questioning if Amazon will bounce back, but they are about Tesla. 


ETFs and Mutual Funds can have something called an expense ratio (ER). Essentially, since they are managing who is and isn’t in their portfolio and they are vetting the companies and deciding what percentage they should hold in the fund- they think their services should get some money. You’ll find expense ratios ranging from 0 dollars to .98 and even higher. A lot of expense ratios for Vanguard, Schwab, and Fidelity are under .10 ER. 


So as you look around at stocks, ETFs, and Mutual Funds look at how their revenue is doing and their stock and dividend history. See if the expense ratio seems worth it. See if you can figure out a general idea of how it’ll affect your taxes. 


There are a lot of things that get reported about a company that can help you figure out how much you’d like to invest or not. There are free websites that have a lot of good info, https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/",u plan needing money dividend long time go ahead set roth ira account dividend tax drag lose money capital gain state tax sometimes treated like income charged income tax rate instead roth ira worry tax hit retirement account selling stock receiving dividend different tax implication depending long hold long received first dividend even different classification dividend qualified nonqualified get taxed different come tax time fill bit w section okay additional money bank account case cover base parent invest help navigate tax tell experience investing far finding good dividend paying stock easier start know like see pepsi coke popular thing consume see steady sale see brand people trust also see brand lot marketing good brand recognition seem come new product acquisition every often stagnant business lot ups down recall lawsuit marketing snafu pr nightmare good diversify one company getting lot bad headline start becoming mismanaged irrelevant left sinking ship lot investor day like go etf etf owning share company owning fund selects handful thousand company track google dividend paying etf see thing like schd schwab see u based dividend paying etf international one see cover singular country region etf mutual fund go portfolio every often make sure bad performer get moved moved list company longer meet criterion deal sweat bullet tsla tank portfolio etf portfolio stock absolutely outperform etf amount upswing price point share dividend payouts stock find babysit make sure turn dud get time stock go time sus bounce back likely like right one questioning amazon bounce back tesla etf mutual fund something called expense ratio er essentially since managing portfolio vetting company deciding percentage hold fund think service get money find expense ratio ranging dollar even higher lot expense ratio vanguard schwab fidelity er look around stock etf mutual fund look revenue stock dividend history see expense ratio seems worth see figure general idea affect tax lot thing get reported company help figure much like invest free website lot good info http stockanalysis com stock ko,Comment,['SCHW'],Banks & Finance

Here's some advice from the 6th richest person in the world.

>Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a long-standing advocate of safe investment options. The majority of his wealth comes from investments in different industries, while his total equity portfolio is valued at a whopping $347 billion.

>Though Buffett’s investment prowess has often been associated with his adept stock-picking skills, his persistent advocacy for index funds sheds light on a simple yet powerful strategy for investors.

>**""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund""**, Buffett had once said. ""The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,"" he further added.

dividends,"If you wanted an unbiased answer you posted on the wrong sub. There is no reason. Don't overcomplicate it, your intuition is correct. Look at total return / cagr / whatever your screener calls it over a long time frame. Are any dividend stocks anywhere near the top? No. Never. Downvote me but it's true. 

Building up a lot of shares that could pay you enough you could live off of is an attractive idea but you could just invest in growth stocks, sell them as you near retirement and start buying dividend stocks. Contrary to what some people here seem to suggest you will have more dividend shares than they do when you retire if you take this approach. The only difference is when you pay taxes on them. Generally you are better off putting off taxes as long as possible to avoid tax drag (ie start with growth / general S&P and then sell them to buy dividend assets closer to retirement). Obviously doesn't matter in a retirement account.

Dividends can outperform in certain market conditions though. They tend to have less drawdown (in exchange for less upside). In a flatish market they also outperform because at least you can reinvest the dividends and have more shares that snowball even if the price doesn't change much. But if you're setting it and forgetting it then OVER A LONG TIMEFRAME THEY WILL UNDERPERFORM. Think about the companies that pay large dividends. They have well established businesses with a lot of cash flow. But they aren't reinvesting that money in pursuit of more growth opportunities, they are paying it to you.

dividends,"SWPPX and VTI overlap 86%. You don't need both. And since Schwab doesn't sell fractional shares of ETFs, and since VTI is $279 per share, the Schwab VTI equivalent SCHB at only $22 would be a better choice than VTI. And if you want fractional shares and automatic investing - both of which are also available with SWPPX - the VTI/SCHB equivalent mutual fund SWTSX is better than both VTI and SCHB.

So you have to answer two questions:

1. Do you want the S&P 500 index or ""total"" US market? Pick one, not both.
2. Do you want an ETF or mutual fund, realizing at Schwab there are no fractional shares or automatic investing with ETFs, but with mutual funds you get both fractional shares and automatic investing of as little as $1 as often as weekly?

* If you want the S&P 500 index in an ETF, get SPLG ($67 per share). Schwab also has the S&P 500 plus (752 stocks) ETF SCHX ($22 per share) that has outperformed the S&P 500 index [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SCHX,VOO](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SCHX,VOO)
* If you want the S&P 500 index in a mutual fund for fractional shares and automatic investing at Schwab, get SWPPX
* If you want the ""total"" US market in an ETF, get SCHB, not VTI.
* If you want the ""total"" US market in a mutual fund for fractional shares and automatic investing at Schwab, get SWTSX

The reason I put ""total"" US market in quotes is because contrary to misconception, the funds don't hold *every* stock in the US stock market. They own a representative sample of 2,421 to 3,611 stocks depending on the fund, not *every* stock in the US stock market.

S&P 500 index vs ""total"" US market? Personal choice. If you look at Overall Return, Exponential Trendline, and Growth of $10,000 in this link, the S&P 500 index (SPLG and SWPPX) has slightly outperformed ""total"" US stock market (SCHB and SWTSX) the past 15 years, and SCHX has outperformed all of them.

As you age, move more to SCHD and BIL. So if you're starting at 20 with 10k, go like 7k into SPLG, 1.5k into BIL (or something similar), and maybe 1.5k into SCHD. Keep this ratio every time you invest more money. 


If you want to dick around, you can take some from BIL or SCHD, maybe 500 of each, and play with 10% of your money in other strategies you like or other specific companies you like.



Every 5 to 10 years, adjust the ratios heavier into SCHD and BIL. Maybe at 30 years old, you start doing 60% SPLG, 20% BIL, and SCHD (again, you can dick around however you'd like, but I'd limit this to 10% or so).



At 40, you're maybe half SPLG and 25% each in the other two. At 50, you're 40%, at 60, you're 30%, and most of your money should be in things like SCHD and BIL for the safety and consistent payouts.

And they charge you an expense ratio for their faulty passive algorithms.

If you want to just buy them yourself, manage your diversification yourself, you will also keep the expense ratio, because there’s no expense ratio for individual stocks.  If you do this, the more stocks the better, as you’re creating your own better diversified index fund.  

I do think it’s worth the expense ratio for foreign stock index funds, though, to let the fund deal with foreign fees ($50 for Schwab) and foreign taxes.  I buy SCHF and SCHE.

I think it is based on the size of the amounts you are moving, but as I am looking at stocks that don't have ADRs this is the best pricing I can find.

The biggest thing is there are varying order minimums on international stocks, like Japan Tobacco is 100 shares which is like $2,800 US (\~415,600 JPY).

dividends,"Its an interesting scenario and i look forward to other people's opinions. So you need to make 12% to generate enough dividends to cover the loans. That is a bit hard to do reliably. I have a lot of dividend paying stocks or ETFs from this article:

I'm averaging about 11.5% so you could probably get 12, by shifting some of the lower yield to higher yield (though that would be more risk theoretically).  I've had mine for about 6 months. Some have increased their dividends, some have cut and one cut dividend completely. 

Anyway, you also have to pay tax on your dividends... do you get a tax deduction off student loan interest? 

I would say go for it. even if you come out of pocket a bit on any shortfall, you're still massively assisting your loan payments and keep those dividends coming in even after the loans are paid off.

Another option that may be better: Pay off your student loans 100% and put your $200 monthly payments that are now freed up into FXAIX (S&P 500 ETF). Super low fee, over time that will be the best investment you could ever make. Retire young.

My largest positions started at these amounts and have grown over time and aren’t great dividend payers.

These along with some others have simply grown over the years and account for about 20% of my portfolio. Another 15% is in closed end income funds. I follow Contrarian Outlook and get most of my closed end fund ideas from this service. About 50% is in individual equities that are solid dividend payers like Chevron, Bristol Myers, Realty Income, Prudential, Morgan Stanley and similar names. I keep 5% in more speculative names like some small biotechs and Ai stocks. The remaining 10% is in money markets and laddered zero coupon Treasuries and CDs with maturities from one to five years. About 90% of my portfolio is in IRAs and other retirement accounts so I’m not paying any current income tax of gains I take or dividends/interest I earn in these accounts.

He doesn’t want to research and buy individual stocks. He simply puts money into an S&P 500 fund every month. The S&P 500 has averaged about a 10% return annually for the last 50 years.

dividends,"No. NEITHER of us knows the math. We don‘t know what OP has. Maybe he has some additional income through other asset classes. WE don‘t know, what OPs goals aside from the stated are (yes, you can have multiple goals simultaneously). Heck, WE don’t even know what this money we know about is invested it. And you seemingly don’t even know what I was talking about. So instead of assuming you know everything come down from your high horse and chill for a bit.

Since you are trying to explain simple concepts to me without recognizing the terms I’m actually referring to: a dividend growth strategy refers to a strategy investing into stocks with particularly fast dividend growth which in most cases don‘t have much starting yield. Think Microsoft, Visa, Eli Lilly. Dividends and growth are in so far opposite as dividends are paid out of company earnings. Doesn‘t mean a company can‘t pay dividends and be a growth stock. (Although a growth stock does most of the time actually refer to the stock price, unlike a dividend growth strategy, which will have appreciating stock prices but doesn‘t necessarily care for it.) So what I mean with (dividend) growth was literally just that, either stocks for dividend growth or for growth (of share prices). You can combine a hardcore dividend strategy and a hardcore growth strategy and you can have something like 3% overall yield with it btw. (Depends on weighting.) And I argued that this is possible because unlike you I don‘t assume I know that OP has merely one goal for their assets, I don‘t assume that they have not thought about this obvious consideration and I don‘t assume that OPs goals are merely about immediate payout (hence the suggestion of inheritance as motivation, passing on the nest egg).

I‘m starting to think you learned like 5 concepts and think you‘re the God of investing.

dividends,"My guess is that you bought some very speculative stocks as most of us do when we start. We want to make a fortune off a small amount of money and although it happens for some, it a very small percentage that do. 

My suggestion is to start by putting money into the Vanguard S&P 500 Admiral Fund or the Charles Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund. This will spread your money into 500 of the top public companies. Honestly, these funds do better than most money managers over time. Set a goal of something like $10,000 to $20,000 in one of these funds and don’t invest in anything else (outside of emergency money in a money market) until you hit that goal. Make sure your dividends and capital gains are reinvested into the fund.

As for learning more about investing, please don’t follow individual stock tips that you see on here! Most of what you will see are speculative investments and not suitable for newer or most investors. Without knowing your level of knowledge, I would start by reading some older books by people like Peter Lynch and Warren Buffet on investing. This will help you form a philosophy on how you want to select stocks down the line. Follow investment news, read magazines like Kiplingers, and realize that not everything reported or written is always correct. 

You have the wonderful benefit of time. Use investment calculators that will show you how much you will have if you put away regular amounts of money at 7-10% returns over time. The power of compounding and reinvesting is super strong!

Analysts do a great job of covering this stock. There are about 20 analysts that have ratings on the company. On a one year forward with a 10% margin for error and a two-year forward with a 20% margin for error Analysts have gotten Pepsi earnings projections correct 100% of the time. I point this out to illustrate that we should be able to trust projections. 

Pepsi is projected to have slower growth in 2025 at only +2%. Growth is expected to return to earnings in 2026 and 2027 at +7% for both years. 

The stock is currently trading at 17.88 x EPS. It’s five year normal PE multiple is about 25x. 

If it continues to trade at around 17.5x at the end of 2027 then your total annual RR will be about 8.5%.

If, however, it returns to a more normal PE of 25x at the end of 2027, then your total annual ROR will be about 22%

From a dividend growth perspective Pepsi looks attractive. It has a great starting dividend yield of 3.7% with a dividend growth projected to be approximately 7% (over the 2x long-term inflation that we are looking for in a Dividend Growth investment). 

Pepsi has an S&P credit rating of A+

dividends,"Ok, if you're going to consider ETFs then know this. Nearly every ETF claims to follow some named index. The index is the list of rules that defines the stock selection universe, how stocks are picked from that universe, how weights are assigned to ones picked, and how and how frequently the mix will be maintained going forward.

The ETF is kept accountable because performance should be measured with how closely they wind up matching their named benchmark index. (Learn to quickly disregard any ETF that has trouble matching its benchmark.)

Ok, now to the fun part. SCHD is a Schwab ETF, so the first stop is to Schwab's website to find the prospectus for SCHD. Inside the prospectus you'll find its benchmark:

""Dow Jones US Dividend 100 Index""

Search for any ETF's benchmark index name, adding the search term ""methodology"" at the end, and boom—among the first search results will be the document you're looking for. The rules for the index. Its methodology.

Here's the doc for SCHD. Actuall the doc covers a bunch of indexes. SCHD is on page 20. Its rules are only a few pages. Read them to find out if SCHD picks stocks like you would pick stocks. (And SCHD is a good place to start to learn this stuff because its methodology is simple compared to many others.)

As you can see, if you want to do what you want to do - live from dividends - without taking excessive risk in new, untried funds that suffer from declining share prices **you will need a lot of money to work with**, at least mid 6-figures or 7 figures. And you want to do that in 20-25 years. How are you going to do that? Not by doing what you plan on doing.

You will end up with more dividends in the end by investing for growth then selling and paying the long term capital gains tax (if any) and buying dividend payers, than by investing in dividend payers from the beginning even with reinvested dividends, the so-called ""dividend snowball"". This comment compares the two approaches

https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/s/vZsW85bqlI

Invest in stocks and/or ETFs to maximize **total return**, which is the combination of capital appreciation and dividend yield, invest as much as you can as often as you can in things that will grow your portfolio into 6 or 7 figures like the people I linked earlier, then in 20-25 years you would sell those growth assets and you will have enough money to buy enough dividend payers to live from dividends.

So what should be the first thing you invest in and form the core and foundation of your portfolio? Take some advice from the 6th richest person in the world:

>Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a long-standing advocate of safe investment options. The majority of his wealth comes from investments in different industries, while his total equity portfolio is valued at a whopping $347 billion.

>Though Buffett’s investment prowess has often been associated with his adept stock-picking skills, his persistent advocacy for index funds sheds light on a simple yet powerful strategy for investors.

>**""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund""**, Buffett had once said. ""The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,"" he further added.

The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index is an index (list) of the 500 largest and most successful US companies, familiar names like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA, Alphabet (Google), Meta, Tesla, Exxon Mobil, Visa, Mastercard, The Home Depot, Costco, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Walmart, Netflix, McDonald's, Starbucks, and hundreds of others. By buying an S&P 500 index fund you own shares in a fund that owns all of those stocks.

There are several S&P 500 index ETFs available. Since you are using MyInvestor I assume you are in the EU. Check with MyInvestor to see which S&P 500 index funds they offer.

After you get rolling with an S&P 500 index fund you can add a growth-oriented fund and/or individual dividend-paying stocks that have high total return.

dividends,"IMO there's really no reason to just focus on one approach to investing. Consider the 'bar-bell' approach. For example, I have structured my IRA to primarily focus on income but also hold some growth and fixed income. Specifically, 65% income focus (REITs, BDCs& energy) 25% growth and 10% fixed income including cash in a MM.

FWIW over the last 5 years the total return on that account, as of March 21,2025, was 161.82% while the S&P return was 165.71 and Dow 161.29. However, that said, over the one year, YTD and 1 month the returns in that account have been 15.27% , 2.43% and -1.61% while the returns for the S&P over those same time periods have been 9.60%, -3.34% and -5.62% with similar results for the Dow.

Only if you are retired and need to generate income because you are no longer working. At 25 years old I assume that isn't the case. At 25 what you should be focusing on **total return**, which is the combination of capital appreciation and dividend yield.

>If you only care about identifying which stocks have performed better over a period of time, the total return is more important than the dividend yield. If you are relying on your investments to provide consistent income, the dividend yield is more important. **If you have a long-term investment horizon and plan on holding a portfolio for a long time, it makes more sense to focus on total return.**

I entered your stock picks into a web site that compares their total returns (with reinvested dividends) and included the S&P 500 index fund SPLG as a reference benchmark. Only one of your picks (ABBV) has outperformed the S&P 500 index since 2012. Scroll down to ""Exponential Trendline"" and ""Growth of $10,000"" in this link.

https://totalrealreturns.com/n/ABBV,SPLG,MO,SO,DUK,O,CVX,XOM,VZ

Even after reinvesting all of those dividends from MO, O, etc. you would have made more money investing in the S&P 500 index and ABBV than in any combination of the others, even with reinvested dividends.

If you want a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks that outperform the S&P 500 index instead of underperforming it, I made a spreadsheet of 134 dividend-paying S&P 500 index stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 index since 1993, or since the stock's IPO if it was after 1993. ABBV is in that spreadsheet.

dividends,"Hi everyone! I’m Samuele, 20M from Europe. I’ve been investing monthly through a DCA plan, initially focused on the U.S. market (mainly S&P 500), but I’m now transitioning towards a more globally diversified strategy.

That said, I’m very interested in dividend growth and the kind of exposure that SCHD provides. Since we Europeans can’t access it directly, I’m thinking of simulating SCHD by manually building a basket of high-quality dividend stocks.

Here’s my current draft portfolio for this “SCHD-like” allocation (weights may be adjusted over time):
	•	JPMorgan Chase (JPM) – 10%
	•	Coca-Cola (KO) – 10%
	•	Altria (MO) – 10%
	•	Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) – 10%
	•	Main Street Capital (MAIN) – 10%
	•	AbbVie (ABBV) – 10%
	•	Realty Income (O) – 10%
	•	Visa (V) – 10%
	•	Microsoft (MSFT) – 10%
	•	Chevron (CVX) – 10%

My goal is to have a mix of reliable dividends + long-term price appreciation, similar to what SCHD offers.

Do you think this approach makes sense? Would you change/add anything to better replicate SCHD’s structure and performance over time?

Any advice or feedback from more experienced investors would be greatly appreciated!",hi everyone samuele europe investing monthly dca plan initially focused u market mainly p transitioning towards globally diversified strategy said interested dividend growth kind exposure schd provides since european access directly thinking simulating schd manually building basket high quality dividend stock current draft portfolio schd like allocation weight may adjusted time jpmorgan chase jpm coca cola ko altria mo johnson johnson jnj main street capital main abbvie abbv realty income visa v microsoft msft chevron cvx goal mix reliable dividend long term price appreciation similar schd offer think approach make sense would change add anything better replicate schd structure performance time advice feedback experienced investor would greatly appreciated,Body,"['V', 'JPM', 'SPGI']",Banks & Finance

dividends,"A similar principal applies.  The higher the yield, usually the more (perceived) risk in the underlying.  Now perception is not always reality but generally the market is more correct than wrong, at least directionally.  

So to answer your question, REITs today ""should"" yield anywhere from 3-5% if they're equity REITs (meaning they own buildings) and 7%+ if they're Loan REITs (meaning they own loans made to building owners).  STWD, if I recall, is 85% a loan book and 15% equity or so, and yields very high because their loan book consists of either leveraged leverage or loans on transitional assets (think development or lease-up).  The point is, many of the higher yielding REITs end up underperforming on the capital appreciation side. 

As far as high yielding REITs go, you could do worse than STWD, but it's also a space I personally believe to be not a good risk return for its investors.  Also note these groups charge significant fees, so my guess is STWD is a company that uses Starwood as its ""investment manager"" and pays a constant asset management fee.  Similar to how BXMT pays a fee to Blackstone.

dividends,"So a little bit off topic from OP's original post, but I'll share my own thoughts. Full disclosure, I'm not an economist or a financial professional of any sort. In regards to your question, if we look back to maybe 20 years ago, george w. Bush proposed privatizing social security. I think at the time, I thought that was a great idea. Who wouldn't want to have total control of the money that they were paying into a system for their future benefit? And if that had come to fruition, think of how much money we'd all have from the s&p 500 increase? It would be awesome. But as I got older, I also saw the scenario where, what if I was approaching retirement in say, 2008 or 2009? Or 2022? So I guess to answer your question, I don't agree that social security should be 100% in risk assests. But like most good compromises, maybe the answer is a hybrid of the two. There are a lot of folks that don't care to learn about financial matters - at all. Who looks out for them? So there is my answer - somewhere in the middle. And maybe a choice to go 80-20, 70-30, etc. depending on one's own level of risk tolerance. Again, way off topic.

dividends,"Paragraphs would help a lot. 



I’m 27 so similar boat and probably a bit different than most people in this sub. A lot might just suggest SCHD and the typical dividend stocks. Personally I disagree for younger folks, I like DGRO and more dividend growth stocks. Like why own the 150 year old dividend king with 3% yield and slow growth, growing their yield 5% a year when you could get a company with a 0.75-1% dividend but on track to grow their dividend 15%+ for the next decade and have share appreciation. For younger people we want the companies that will become dividend kings for a better yield on cost. 




For the personal bit, there are plenty of women out there who don’t mind working a bit and didn’t catch the tiktok brainrot. Finding a partner to settle down with who works and contributes will seriously help with FI. She doesn’t have to have exactly the same mindset, but also can’t be a polar opposite that buys designer and doesn’t save. I’d avoid nurses and such as they’re not known to be what you seem to want. Maybe look for a techie, engineer, vet or lawyer. A field where women aren’t common or one that takes real dedication, imo that suggests someone who is a bit more career/learning oriented and less likely to want to be a boring SAHM or “influencer”. 




Roth contributions can be withdrawn penalty free at any age. So if you contribute the $7k or whatever for 20 years you will have $140k there you can use during retirement. There are other potential ways to access funds before 59.5 but personally I like to match my Roth contributions in a regular taxable brokerage so I have some easy to access funds once I retire. 



You’re doing fine tho, probably on track to comfortably retire by 40 with a few mil as long as you don’t go crazy when you buy a house.

dividends,">If you’ve 25 more years before you retire, what dividends stocks will you prefer to invest in? 

If I was 25 years before retirement I would be focused on on growing my portfolio by looking for **total return** (capital appreciation + dividend yield) that is as good or better than the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. If some of those stocks pay dividends that's great, but it isn't critical at that stage (wealth accumulation) of the investing life cycle.

>If you only care about identifying which stocks have performed better over a period of time, the total return is more important than the dividend yield. If you are relying on your investments to provide consistent income, the dividend yield is more important. **If you have a long-term investment horizon and plan on holding a portfolio for a long time, it makes more sense to focus on total return.**

For specific dividend stocks, look at this spreadsheet I made of 134 **dividend-paying** S&P 500 index stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 index total return since 1993 or since the stock's IPO if it was after 1993.

dividends,"**2nd Point (Growth vs Dividends):**

Whatever the case, wherever you invest, the only thing that matters in the end is ""I put 10,000 in and after 20 years my investment is more than that"". This can be done by growth ETFs and by dividend ETFs as well. The ETF that provides growth is heavily invested in growth stocks. The ETF that provides dividends is heavily invested in dividend stocks. NOTICE THE NAV (NET ASSET VALUE) of the ETFs. On growth ETFs, the NAV tends to grow over time. On MANY dividend ETFs, even with high dividend yields, you will notice the NAV decreasing. So in that case if you gain from the dividends, you lose from the NAV decreasing. Some dividend ETFs are really worth it (SCHD for example), but I think you are better off with growth ETFs for now since you are young.

Also, growth ETFs are characterized Accumulating and dividend ETFs are characterized Distributing as they distribute dividends.

**3rd Point (ETF exchange and exposure):**

Each ETF is traded in a Stock Exchange (with similar ETFs in other exchanges/currencies). Each ETFs has a focused exposure, either in a specific geographic region, or a specific sector, or certain market cap of stocks etc etc.

Example: 

*VOO*

* Traded: US Stock Exchange
* Currency: USD
* Exposure: Tracking the S&P 500, basically the 500 biggest companies in the US

*VUAA*:

* Traded: Italian Stock Exchange / London Stock Exchange
* Currency: EUR / GBP
* Exposure: Tracking the S&P 500, basically the 500 biggest companies in the US (Same as VOO)

*VWCE*:

* Traded: German Stock Exchange
* Currency: EUR
* Exposure: Seeks to track the performance of the performance of the FTSE All-World Index

As you can see, you can invest in VUAA (100% US) and VWCE (64% US, 26% other Global) and gain the exposure you want to these markets.",nd point growth v dividend whatever case wherever invest thing matter end put year investment done growth etf dividend etf well etf provides growth heavily invested growth stock etf provides dividend heavily invested dividend stock notice nav net asset value etf growth etf nav tends grow time many dividend etf even high dividend yield notice nav decreasing case gain dividend lose nav decreasing dividend etf really worth schd example think better growth etf since young also growth etf characterized accumulating dividend etf characterized distributing distribute dividend rd point etf exchange exposure etf traded stock exchange similar etf exchange currency etf focused exposure either specific geographic region specific sector certain market cap stock etc etc example voo traded u stock exchange currency usd exposure tracking p basically biggest company u vuaa traded italian stock exchange london stock exchange currency eur gbp exposure tracking p basically biggest company u voo vwce traded german stock exchange currency eur exposure seek track performance performance ftse world index see invest vuaa u vwce u global gain exposure want market,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

dividends,"hi
ETF is just a collection of individual stocks.  
When you buy ETF (index or mutual fund) you buying a company share that buy a collection of stocks of their choosing!  They have CONTROL of what to buy, what to keep, what to invest in.  You rely on their expertise to make the “right decision“ on your behalf.

Whether you choose Index funds (ETF) or individual stock the process of choosing stocks is the same.  There is no shortcut to make money in the stock market.

Every body looses money at one point in time or another in the stock market.
Heck, Warren Buffet admitted in the annual shareholder meeting, that he and not someone else contributed to Berkshire’s 16B loss in 2022!

You have to know the nature of the business, and know how to read and understand financial reports just to stand a chance!

If you don't know the nature of the business.  DON’T buy the stock.  You don't know what you got yourself into!

The Richest Man In Babylon by George S Clason is a good book.
The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham is an excellent one though abit thick.
Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham  is a good book but it is thicker than the Bible and it is not an easy read.

For those who don't know, Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffet mentor, a genius, and an excellent investor on his own.

You can read all of that, or watch 

Warren Buffet three basic rules 14min long on Youtube.  It is a good watch.  To summarize 

Stock is a piece of the business.  Before you buy stock, ask yourself:

Will the business be around 10 years from now?
How much is that business, at that time, worth?
What is the price are you willing to pay for this business?

You don't need to be exact, crude approximation will do.

The way I do it is average latest three years Earning (EPS) x 10 =  Fair value of the stock

Suppose $PBR, Petro-Brazil, has average EPS of 0.80.  Because every one share we American buys (ADR), we get 2  $PBR shares,  thus the fair price is 0.8 x 2x 10 = 16 dollars

Im NOT paying 16 bucks, there is no money to be made should I buy at the fair price!

So, I waited.  Then one day Mr. Market got rejected by his crush.  Devastated, he decided to sell his $PBR stock to me at 13.  What a bargain, I figure 🫢

I jump on the deal and purchased the shares, then I wait.  

It dropped to 12.  Im anxious, I panic, I wish I have money to buy more. I don’t   so I waited.  

While I waiting, the company decide to pay quarterly dividend of 0.25 per ADR shares x 4.  If I kept the stock my rate of return is 1.00 / 13 ~ 9%.  On average, I dont think you can do better than 9% return on a ETF.

I take that money and re-invest in the business to make more money for me.
Now,  I do not use the automated dividend reinvesting plan most brokerage have.

I want control!  Control over the price I will pay!
Not the price whatever the market dictates right after I get my money on the dividend pay date.  

Why do I choose $PBR, well…I read the annual reports and …Warren Buffet 3 simple rules…

Oil will still be around 10 years from now.
Their fair price is around 17/ ADR share

$PBR has 13 years worth of reserves.
Big profit—It only cost them 35 dollars to produce a barrel.
Qualified management.
Steady Revenues.
Manageable debt!
Positive Net Income!

Some politics, but again it’s politics!
Selic rate (Brazilean real to dollar exchange rate) can be a bitch but, I can take it!

Pays dividend (by Brazilian law at least 45% of their net income) 
Do shares buybacks.
Decent Cash equivalent.
Room for growth.

Overall promising.  Price  is attractive (P/E ratio less than 15).  

What not to like?

As part owner, I want to get pay!
Owners get pay three ways:

Directly—Dividend cashback

Indirectly—Share buybacks, your part of ownership increases without you spending a dime!

Market Valuation—your share now worth more

Rather than paying dividend, the management decided to take the earnings (Net Income) and re-invest in business or buying another business.  It is a gamble!  A venture!   It could pay off or you will pay.

You rely on the management team expertise to put that money to better use.

Dividend or no dividend is a choice.  

Beware some dividend stock is not a dividend stock at all.

$XPAY an ETF (Index Fund) pays monthly distribution, around  20% a year.   But it is not a dividend stock!
They take your money on one hand and give back (20%) to you on another!  The remainder 80% they gamble with S&P 500, hoping the price will go up.  Rinse and repeat every year.  If this is appealing to you, go for it.  But I don't recommended.

My experience tells me ETF in general are less riskier than individual stocks because you have more variety.   But it also limit your chance of making money compare to individual stock.  

Okay, It is getting too long!

PS:  If have both $PBR and $EC, petro-brazil and petro-colombia respectively, six months out of the year collectively, you will received dividend!

are some useful tips:

SEC is your friend.  SEC.gov use EDGAR full text search for company annual reports. 

Invest first in yourself!  Money may come and go but the knowledge & experience stays.

We all fail at one point in time or another. Don’t let failure   holds you back!

dividends,">$2,500 to invest in Dividends. 

>I was thinking of high-yield ETF like MSTY

>I'm 19 in college, and I'm hoping to have success once I graduate

Let's try to get you started in the right direction so you can achieve the success you want.

At 19, you shouldn't be *focused* on dividends or ""high yield ETFs"". You should be focused on total return, which is dividend yield *plus* capital appreciation.

>If you only care about identifying which stocks have performed better over a period of time, the total return is more important than the dividend yield. If you are relying on your investments to provide consistent income, the dividend yield is more important. **If you have a long-term investment horizon and plan on holding a portfolio for a long time, it makes more sense to focus on total return.**

>[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111314/which-more-important-dividend-yield-or-total-return.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111314/which-more-important-dividend-yield-or-total-return.asp)

So what should you be investing in? Here's some advice from the 6th richest person in the world:

>Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a long-standing advocate of safe investment options. The majority of his wealth comes from investments in different industries, while his total equity portfolio is valued at a whopping $347 billion.

>Though Buffett’s investment prowess has often been associated with his adept stock-picking skills, his persistent advocacy for index funds sheds light on a simple yet powerful strategy for investors.

>**""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund""**, Buffett had once said. ""The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,"" he further added.

>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-believes-p-500-170220804.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-believes-p-500-170220804.html)

There are many S&P 500 index funds available including SPLG, VOO, SPY, IVV, FXAIX, and SWPPX. Pick one. That will get you started with a solid investment while you educate yourself about investing. Here are two YouTube playlists you should watch

If a video is in both playlists you don't have to watch it twice.

Don't be in a hurry to add more investments beyond your S&P 500 index fund. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Anything you add should give you something beyond what you are getting in your S&P 500 index fund.

dividends,"That’s an interesting projection! It looks like you’ve done some calculations based on SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF) with a 12% annualized total return and a 3.5% dividend yield at the end of the 20-year period. I’ll assume you’re sharing this as a hypothetical scenario and checking if it aligns with reasonable expectations.
To break it down: Investing $50,000 annually for 20 years, with dividends reinvested, and assuming a 12% annualized return (which includes both price appreciation and dividend growth), would indeed grow a portfolio significantly. By the end, with a 3.5% yield on the final portfolio value, you’d be generating that $126,096.25 annually, or roughly $10,508.02 monthly, as you stated.
If you’d like, I can double-check the math or adjust for different assumptions (e.g., a more conservative return like 8-10%, or a varying dividend yield). SCHD’s historical performance and dividend growth could also factor in—its current yield is around 3.4% (as of early 2025), with a focus on dividend-paying U.S. companies.

dividends,"> I'm 19, going to graduate high school soon and plan on getting started with investing as soon as I get a job. I've been checking out ETFs recently and noticed that a lot of them use options. Stuff like JEPI, JEPQ, QQQY, IWMY, XDTE, LQDW.

I'm glad you asked these questions. We might keep you from heading off into the weeds in the wrong direction.

If you are 19 years old you shouldn't be investing in any of those. Those ETFs are designed to throw off distributions for people who (are retired and) need income. A 19 year old should be focused on growing your wealth, not generating a few hundred dollars a year (assuming the modest amount a 19 year old would have invested) of taxable distributions.

Think about it. Take JEPI for example. JEPI's yield is 7.14% per year. So if you invested $1,000 in JEPI you would get $71.40 per year in dividends. That's $1.37 per week. Before taxes. Really? You're thinking of investing $1,000 of your hard-earned money just to get a little over $1 a week in distributions after taxes. How is that going to help you?

Sure, the shares of JEPI should increase in value, but not as much as a plain vanilla S&P 500 index fund's shares would increase in value. Even if your reinvested JEPI's dividends, you would make more money investing in an S&P 500 index fund than in JEPI. Scroll down to ""Growth of $10,000"" in this link.

**At 19 you need to focus on growing your wealth**, not on trying to collect a dollar a week in dividends. Focus on total return, the combination of capital appreciation and dividend yield, not just dividend yield.

>If you only care about identifying which stocks have performed better over a period of time, the total return is more important than the dividend yield. If you are relying on your investments to provide consistent income, the dividend yield is more important. **If you have a long-term investment horizon and plan on holding a portfolio for a long time, it makes more sense to focus on total return.**

Here's some advice from the 6th richest person in the world:

>Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has been a long-standing advocate of safe investment options. The majority of his wealth comes from investments in different industries, while his total equity portfolio is valued at a whopping $347 billion.

>Though Buffett’s investment prowess has often been associated with his adept stock-picking skills, his persistent advocacy for index funds sheds light on a simple yet powerful strategy for investors.

>**""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund""**, Buffett had once said. ""The trick is not to pick the right company. The trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low-cost way,"" he further added.

The average total return of the S&P 500 index since 1957 when it reached its current configuration is 10.13% per year. The current maximum contribution to a Roth IRA is $7000 per year. Let's say you contribute $560 per month to a Roth IRA. That's $6,720 per year, that's under the limit. If invested in an S&P 500 index fund with an average annual return of 10.13% per year, how long would it take you to become a millionaire?

Answer: 27.6 years, when you are 46.6 years old.

Either SCHG or QQQM you only need one.

It depends on your age and risk tolerance. SCHG and QQQM are going to be more volatile. For example, Year to Date the S&P 500 index (SPLG or VOO) is down -4%, QQQM is down -6%, and SCHG is down -8%. If that is going to bother you you should have more S&P 500 index (SPLG or VOO) and less growth (SCHG or QQQM).

But since 2010 the exponential trendline for SPLG or VOO is +13.44% per year, SCHG is +16% per year, and QQQM is +18.66% per year. So if you can handle the up and down volatility of SCHG or QQQM you will likely make more money the more you have and the longer you invest.

If you are younger (20s-30s) you should have more SCHG or QQQM so you have more time to benefit from the higher growth than when you are in your 40s or 50s.

Younger or higher risk tolerance might be 60-70% SPLG or VOO, 40-30% SCHG or QQQM, older or lower risk tolerance might be 70-90% SPLG or VOO, 30-10% SCHG or QQQM.",prefer splg lower expense ratio lower share price buy fractional share voo voo ok two either schg qqqm need one depends age risk tolerance schg qqqm going volatile example year date p index splg voo qqqm schg going bother p index splg voo le growth schg qqqm since exponential trendline splg voo per year schg per year qqqm per year handle volatility schg qqqm likely make money longer invest younger schg qqqm time benefit higher growth younger higher risk tolerance might splg voo schg qqqm older lower risk tolerance might splg voo schg qqqm,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

wallstreetbets,"I actually went through u/rubiksSugarCube's post history and plugged three of his relevant posts into ChatGPT (I have the paid version). I then asked ChatGPT to do a deep research and see if there was anything indicating that a drop in the S&P would cause a debt crisis.

The basic gist (I'm still reading it, it's hella long) is that a stock market drop might reduce investor willingness to buy bonds right when the US needs to finance 9 trillion out of 36 trillion dollars of debt.  There is some indication this is happening because bond yields went up during the market crash.

Normally stock market gains and bond yields are correlated.  Stocks go down, treasury demand goes up, yields go down.  However, this situation is unusual.  Because of political instability, the potential for a recession, and the massive debt the US already has, investors in long term bonds may demand more money for buying bonds.  They may, for example, be afraid of inflation, or other players who hold bonds may need cash due to margin calls causing them to sell bonds which increases yield.  This would increase the yield as stocks go down.  To quote ChatGPT:

> Liquidity Crunch (“Dash for Cash”): In a severe market panic, investors and institutions sometimes need cash immediately – to cover losses, meet margin calls (loan collateral requirements), or simply as a precaution. In those moments, they may sell anything they can, including safe Treasuries, to raise cash. This occurred briefly in March 2020 during the COVID crash, and a similar scenario played out in early April 2025.

> U.S. stocks were already slumping on tariff fears, but then an abrupt wave of Treasury selling hit as well. **On one Monday in April, even though equities were down, Treasury yields spiked – the 10-year yield soared by 17 basis points (0.17%) that day, swinging wildly in one of the most volatile trading sessions in decades​ reuters.com** . What happened? Analysts reported that some hedge funds and investors faced losses and sold off Treasuries to meet margin calls (forced cash demands)​ reuters.com . This “violent” Treasury selloff was so extreme that it echoed the pandemic-era “dash for cash,” when even top-quality bonds were dumped for liquidity​ reuters.com
​


> reuters.com. In a deep “risk-off” environment where normally everyone would be buying Treasuries, investors were instead liquidating them – an alarming sign. Regulators grew very nervous at these signs of strain in the $29 trillion Treasury market, which is supposed to be the world’s most liquid and stable bond market​ reuters.com
. Yields on 30-year Treasuries jumped about 60 basis points in that episode (their fastest rise in decades)​
reuters.com , indicating a sudden lack of buyers. Such moves are not typical of a healthy market – they indicated that the Treasury market’s “plumbing” was clogged by frantic selling​ reuters.com . This kind of scenario – where stocks and bonds fall together due to a liquidity crunch or loss of confidence – is exactly how a stock crash could morph into a broader financial crisis.

Now the US needs to refinance 9 trillion dollars of debt in 2025.  Of that 9 trillion dollars, 70% must be refinanced before June (Hmm.... I wonder if this has anything to do with the 90 day pause on tariffs from Trump).  

I'll let ChatGPT have the last word:

> Putting it together: A steep stock market drop could damage the economy and investor psyche, just as the U.S. Treasury is flooding the market with new bonds in 2025. If investors get skittish and step back, the government might have to offer much higher yields to attract financing – or, in a worst case, struggle to roll over its debts smoothly. That is the scenario in which a stock slump “triggers” a debt crisis: not directly, but by creating economic stress and fear that lead bond investors to back off.",actually went u rubikssugarcube post history plugged three relevant post chatgpt paid version asked chatgpt deep research see anything indicating drop p would cause debt crisis basic gist still reading hella long stock market drop might reduce investor willingness buy bond right u need finance trillion trillion dollar debt indication happening bond yield went market crash normally stock market gain bond yield correlated stock go treasury demand go yield go however situation unusual political instability potential recession massive debt u already investor long term bond may demand money buying bond may example afraid inflation player hold bond may need cash due margin call causing sell bond increase yield would increase yield stock go quote chatgpt liquidity crunch dash cash severe market panic investor institution sometimes need cash immediately cover loss meet margin call loan collateral requirement simply precaution moment may sell anything including safe treasury raise cash occurred briefly march covid crash similar scenario played early april u stock already slumping tariff fear abrupt wave treasury selling hit well one monday april even though equity treasury yield spiked year yield soared basis point day swinging wildly one volatile trading session decade reuters com happened analyst reported hedge fund investor faced loss sold treasury meet margin call forced cash demand reuters com violent treasury selloff extreme echoed pandemic era dash cash even top quality bond dumped liquidity reuters com reuters com deep risk environment normally everyone would buying treasury investor instead liquidating alarming sign regulator grew nervous sign strain trillion treasury market supposed world liquid stable bond market reuters com yield year treasury jumped basis point episode fastest rise decade reuters com indicating sudden lack buyer move typical healthy market indicated treasury market plumbing clogged frantic selling reuters com kind scenario stock bond fall together due liquidity crunch loss confidence exactly stock crash could morph broader financial crisis u need refinance trillion dollar debt trillion dollar must refinanced june hmm wonder anything day pause tariff trump let chatgpt last word putting together steep stock market drop could damage economy investor psyche u treasury flooding market new bond investor get skittish step back government might offer much higher yield attract financing worst case struggle roll debt smoothly scenario stock slump trigger debt crisis directly creating economic stress fear lead bond investor back,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
wallstreetbets,"The bond market went INSANE the other night. That’s a HUGE issue (depression), this is why this guy called off some of the tariffs. Still, he wants a recession (not a depression, not yet). 

Here are some longer parts from the WSJ explaining what’s going on. I suggest actually reading some long form articles in this to try to understand it (I know, so much behind paywalls :-/

Before I share the piece, you should also know that part of the faith in treasuries are the rule of law, investment research, and things like independent universities, and having allies.  The NIH cuts and the firings at HHS are a bigger deal than most people understand. 

From the piece: 
The stock-market meltdown that accompanied President Trump’s intensifying trade war in recent weeks was unsettling enough. The fall in the dollar and rise in bond yields that went with it have been truly ominous. So ominous, it might be why Don changed course, at least temporarily, by pausing some of his tariffs Wednesday.

Normally when investors are this scared they seek safety, and nothing is safer than the dollar and Treasury debt.  

But despite mounting fear of recession, the usual flight to safety hasn’t materialized. That is for several reasons, some relatively superficial, such as inflation risks, and one more fundamental.

In recent years, the U.S. has boasted faster growth, bigger advances in technology, and more-ample supplies of cheap energy than almost any other major economy. Investors worldwide flocked to “American exceptionalism” by buying its assets. 

The U.S. is still (for now) exceptional, but it is also less predictable, more antagonistic, and more isolated. For foreign investors, that makes it less safe

…

This (bond) behavior is unusual. In the seven prior episodes when the S&P 500 fell as much or more, the dollar rose. In the last episode, from January to June 2022, bond yields did rise, because the Federal Reserve was raising short-term interest rates sharply to combat inflation.

…

Inflation might be part of the explanation now. Tariffs will hurt demand and economic growth, which would normally prompt the Fed to lower interest rates. But tariffs will also raise inflation, at least temporarily, which makes it harder to justify rate cuts.

Nonetheless, with recession risks rising sharply, traders are now betting the Fed will cut rates this year. So the Fed isn’t the main reason bond yields are up. 

Technical factors might be playing a role. Hedge funds might have been forced to liquidate bondholdings after their positions went against them, and dealers have done less to smooth out volatility.

Nonetheless, technical factors can’t explain why bonds and the dollar began behaving strangely weeks ago. The more fundamental explanation is that global investors might be changing how they view the U.S.

…

The dollar has long been the world’s reserve currency. Investors and central banks use dollars to defend their own currencies, pay for imports, repay debt, and for emergencies. Businesses of all nationalities transact across borders in dollars. All that creates an enormous need to hold dollars, which are typically invested in Treasurys. 

…

So the U.S. needs foreigners to keep rolling over the bonds they hold, and buying new ones. Even a small pullback would cause yields to jump. Jay Barry, head of global rates strategy at JPMorgan Chase, estimates that yields rise a third of a percentage point for each $300 billion decline in foreign official holdings of Treasurys.

There were recent fears that China might try to retaliate against Trump’s tariffs by selling some of its own bondholdings. There is no evidence that it has, but the possibility has highlighted the risks to the U.S. of a trade war morphing into financial war.

wallstreetbets,"Sure, but I see it more as a timing thing. The Chinese EV market started in earnest \~2012, with mandates for taxis being EVs creating a huge market for them, which eventually lead to the current situation 

Compare that to Europe, where it only really began to take momentum in \~2018-2020, with markedly lower sticks and carrots to drive demand. I think that's where the Europeans kinda fucked up; the Chinese gave rebates, they have large fuel taxes, they straight up banned ICE in some urban areas by their license plate policies, they did  LOT to stimulate demand in a way that the EU just didn't do. You need to make a big market for a product and then let capitalism do its thing

So, they started later and were given a way softer push to compete. While it's bad in the short time, in the long term I think it'll still work out. After all, VW still sells millions of cars in China, same with all the other European brands (expect the French lol). Even if Chinese brands take 90% of the market, that remaining 10% is a HUGE chunk of cars

Reason is that bank earnings cause shifts in bond markets..., and we know that the past 4 days yields have been shooting straight up, i.e. 10Y from 3.9 on Monday to 4.4 at today's close.

If bank earnings come in poor and banks start to sell off, 10Y could rise up to 4.5 or 4.6 tomorrow and that could spook wider markets.  If bank earnings come in strong and banks catch a bid, 10Y could fall to 4.2 or 4.3 and that could cause a big rally.

wallstreetbets,"**TL;DR**
This chart is the flowchart version of a hedge fund trying to farm nickels using 10x leverage, in a system duct-taped together by repo plumbing and the hope that volatility stays dead. If this blows up, the Fed has to come out with the “volatility suppressor tool” (a.k.a. buy everything that isn’t nailed down) before margin calls start going out like Amber Alerts.

Short: GS, MS, JPM, TLT
Long: VIX

**What the Hell am I looking at?**

This flowchart illustrates the U.S. Treasury basis trade, a.k.a. the 900 IQ arbitrage strat where hedge funds try to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller made of illiquidity, duration risk, and repo gremlins.

**Here’s the strategy:**
	1.	Hedge funds go long a Treasury bond (usually with borrowed money via the repo market) and short the futures contract on that bond.

	2.	The bond they long is the CTD (Cheapest to Deliver) — think of it as the bond equivalent of buying Temu knockoffs instead of brand name, but only if the Temu knockoff is able to settle into your futures position. *Looks good enough, we’ll let it slide*

	3.	They make money if the “basis” (cash bond price - futures price - repo cost) narrows, which it usually does unless the market experiences significant volatility.

**How they do it:**
	•	Repo dealers slide them the money to buy the bonds. *$20 is $20*

	•	Prime brokers pass the CTD bonds around like they’re at a frat party.

	•	CME clearing asks for margin like a little bitch.

	•	Futures are shorted against the long bond so it’s “delta-neutral,” which is finance speak for “we think we’re hedged but we can’t find the paperwork.”

**Why this matters:**
If and when this spontaneously unwinds (like say, in a liquidity crisis), you get forced deleveraging, margin calls, and Treasury yields go turbo — not because inflation is surging, but because hedge funds are panic-selling like they heard *good afternoon* at a Jpow speech.

Yields skyrocket, bonds fall with equities, and the FED has to act quickly to dampen volatility.

**How to profit:**
OTM SPY puts or VIX calls
Puts on banks with highly leveraged brokerage arms (GS, MS, JPM) or ETFs that include them (XLF, KRE)

**Play for gambler’s ruin speed-runners**

Deep ITM TLT puts (synthetic short) 

Wait for tangible distress in the markets (BTC crashing HARD is a good indicator that risk is off the table for real)

Then Deep ITM TLT calls (synthetic long)

wallstreetbets,"If you look at the statistics of the past 25 years we've had this event twice. Massive rallies in 2008 and also in 2002. The actual bottom came a few months later but it did mean you were very close. In 2002 the March 2003 bottom was basically equivalent to the July low. In 2008 you did have another 20% down to go but it was a period of time between the high of the March rally and November of '08 and the low of the market March 2009 so if we look at lows and highs from those two months it is considerably less than 20%. If we were to repeat something similar it would mean 20% off the high of yesterday which would be s&p 4400 which also would be a very normal recessionary trade. It's also possible 4,800 holds but you do have good odds that we at least revisit that range

Would I go short? Absolutely not. If you're going to short you want days like yesterday where you have this statistical advantage and a massive rally that some people are going to sell into. Personally I would have covered that today if I would have went short yesterday 

The only short that makes even a little sense to me is if you short calls into shares that you already own and you want to cover when we revisit lows or if we exceed yesterday's highs.

wallstreetbets,"With options and the ability to borrow money (buying on ""margin""), one can significantly leverage their buying power, especially if they are quite certain the market is going to dip or rise sharply due to insider information ahead of time.

Buying on margin is especially dangerous, especially with derivatives, because you could potentially lose more than your stake in the investment if you are wrong. However, if you are right, you can make more than 100% profit with derivatives -- potentially \*much\* more for unlikely bets. But with insider information ahead of time, it's kind of like playing slots and knowing when the jackpot is going to hit.

Say you buy call contracts on the S&P 500, which was about 5,000 at the start of today, rising 300 points or about 6%, with an expiration at close of trading. Now a 6% move either way in the US market is very rare -- it may happen about once every few years. So calls at the start of trading today for it to happen by the close would have been incredibly inexpensive -- a very outside chance it would happen.

Since the markets had fallen about 12% since the tariff announcement, it's not unforeseeable that they'd rise significantly, even 6%, in the event the tariffs were delayed. Many people without insider knowledge know this, and many probably took positions on this outside chance. Like putting a dollar into a slot machine, hoping it might hit the jackpot. But you're not sure, so you don't put a lot, and if you're smart you hedge your bets in case the tariffs go unchanged.

However, if you \*know\* the tariffs are about to be rolled back, you could use margin and derivatives to bet massively on that 6% raise, knowing there is a good chance it will happen, and even if it doesn't reach all the way to 6%, a favorable move upward would make the value of those contracts rise. So if you know within an hour when this announcement is going to be made, you have pretty close to a sure bet, and can buy accordingly.

On WallStreetBets subreddit you'll find people who make 5,000% or more quite regularly due to these types of opportunities. But there is massive luck involved for most. If, however, you know what's coming and bet $1,000,000 today, with the S&P rising 9% to 5,450 or so, you would have made $50,000,000 on those contracts.

Of course, any bullish investment today made a lot of money, it doesn't have to be such an extreme example. But needless to say, someone with insider information and expertise at how to play it would have done quite well with whatever they put in.

And Trump's cronies have a lot to invest.",option ability borrow money buying margin one significantly leverage buying power especially quite certain market going dip rise sharply due insider information ahead time buying margin especially dangerous especially derivative could potentially lose stake investment wrong however right make profit derivative potentially much unlikely bet insider information ahead time kind like playing slot knowing jackpot going hit say buy call contract p start today rising point expiration close trading move either way u market rare may happen every year call start trading today happen close would incredibly inexpensive outside chance would happen since market fallen since tariff announcement unforeseeable rise significantly even event tariff delayed many people without insider knowledge know many probably took position outside chance like putting dollar slot machine hoping might hit jackpot sure put lot smart hedge bet case tariff go unchanged however know tariff rolled back could use margin derivative bet massively raise knowing good chance happen even reach way favorable move upward would make value contract rise know within hour announcement going made pretty close sure bet buy accordingly wallstreetbets subreddit find people make quite regularly due type opportunity massive luck involved however know coming bet today p rising would made contract course bullish investment today made lot money extreme example needle say someone insider information expertise play would done quite well whatever put trump crony lot invest,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

wallstreetbets,"Let's reiew some details around Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. On April 14th, 2020, Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter. Initially, Twitter resisted the proposal. Six days after the initial announcement (April 20th), Musk announced he'd secured funding for the deal, funding which, according to a [commitment letter from Morgan Stanley](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922049844/tm2213189d8_ex99-i.htm), included a $12.5 billion margin loan against Musk's TSLA stock. Then, on April 25th, Twitter dropped its opposition to the proposal and accepted Musk's offer.

But the $12.5 billion margin loan never happened. And I find the timeline of how it didn't happen very interesting. On May 4th, Musk announced [revised financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922056055/tm2214608-1_sc13da.htm) which cut the margin loan to $6.25 billion. Then on May 13th Musk announced was the deal ""on hold"", before two hours later saying he was ""Still committed to acquisition"". But this left people wondering what the hell Musk was doing. Then on May 24th Musk announced [new financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922064655/tm2216931d1_sc13da.htm) with no margin loan. At the time, financial columnist Matt Levine [interpreted this as proof](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-26/elon-called-off-his-margin-loan) that Musk was just kidding about the deal being ""on hold"". After all, it's not like putting a deal that's already been signed ""on hold"" is a thing in the M&A world anyway.

Except then in July, Musk's lawyers sent Twitter a letter, [made public in an SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm), saying they really were terminating the deal based on alleged breach of contract on Twitter's part. Twitter sued, and Musk looked ready to fight, before finally going ahead with the acquisition in October.

It's a good thing (for Musk, anyway) that the margin loan never happened. According to the commitment letter, the $12.5 billion loan would've been against $62.5 billion in TSLA stock, and would be subject to a margin call if the loan value ever exceeded 35% of the value of the collateral. Furthermore, on January 3rd of the following year, TSLA closed below $325/share, and almost fell below $305/share three days later before recovering. (TSLA has since undergone a 3:1 stock split, so if you're comparing to the current price, think of this as almost hitting $100/share.) Under the original financing plan for the Twitter deal, this almost certainly would have result in a margin call, since in the entire month of October, when the deal closed, the stock had never fallen below $600/share (or $200/share in split-adjusted terms).

Then, in a coda almost nobody noticed, Tesla released the [proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312523094075/d451342ddef14a.htm) for its 2023 shareholder meeting, which included a section on ""Board Responsiveness"", which stated, ""We have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters... As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to... Amending our pledging policy to... cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock"". No such policy was mentioned in the [2022 proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459022022992/tsla-pre14a_20220804.htm), obviously—it would've made the original proposal to acquire Twitter with a $12.5 billion margin loan impossible.

Taken together, all of this makes me think that *somebody* freaked out when Musk announced his original plan to finance the Twitter acquisition, and basically told him, ""what the fuck? No, you can't do that"". When billionaires get margin called, it can absolutely tank the stock price, which is probably why the commitment letter set such a relatively low threshold (35%) for triggering a margin call.

I think what happened in May 2022 is Musk initially tried to placate whoever was telling him ""fuck no"" by cutting the size of the loan in half, and when they weren't placated he tried to back out fo the deal, because he made the offer when he thought he could do the deal entirely with borrowed money and got cold feet when faced with the prospect of actually having to sell, rather than just borrow against, his TSLA stock to get the deal done. But in telling Musk ""fuck no"", whoever it was **saved Musk from himself and a margin call**.

It doesn't really matter who the ""somebody"" was, though I can't help but wonder if it was Tesla's largest shareholder—Vanguard. While known mainly for pioneering index funds, not noisy activist investing, and while I have never heard of them *starting* a proxy fight, Vanguard 100% *will* side with activist investors in proxy fights if they feel it's warranted. And they much more frequently ""engage"" with companies, and when your largest shareholder engages with you, you take it seriously, even when the engagement is phrased as polite suggestions. So I wonder if all the will-he-or-won't-he drama about acquiring Twitter in 2022 was because Vanguard wasn't happy with Musk's original plan.

Anyway, none of this means a Musk margin call is *impossible*, but I suspect it could only happen if Tesla was publicly known to be at risk of bankruptcy. I company is in serious trouble, but if you're betting against it (as I am), don't suddenly start getting careless if, say, the stock price drops to $120/share and there's a rumor going around further drops are a sure bet because Musk is getting margin called.

wallstreetbets,"Well, folks, what started as a hopeful relief rally in Asia and Europe turned into a total dumpster fire for U.S. markets today. Wall Street was riding high with stocks up nearly 5% early on, but then Trump doubled down on his promise of insane 104% tariffs on Chinese imports, and it all went to hell. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%, closing below 5000 for the first time in a year, while the Nasdaq took a 2%+ beating and is now down 25% from its December peak. Meanwhile, long-dated U.S. bond yields spiked hard—30-year yields are up 36 bps in just two days, one of the wildest jumps ever. Investors are freaking out, and it’s not hard to see why: this trade war escalation with China is looking uglier by the minute.

Overseas, it’s a mixed bag. Japan’s Nikkei had a banger day, up 6%, and European stocks popped 3.5%, their best in over three years—guess they’re still riding the “maybe we dodge the worst of this” wave. But China’s yuan? Oof, it’s getting crushed, hitting an all-time low past 7.40 per dollar offshore, and people are betting Beijing might weaponize its currency in this mess. Safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc are up over 1% against the dollar, while oil’s down 2%—Brent crude’s lost 30% in a year. Oh, and Trump’s team is out here trying to sweet-talk Japan and South Korea into tariff deals, but the China standoff is the real market-killer. Optimism? Dead. Futures are pointing to a 2% drop at tomorrow’s open. Buckle up.

The kicker? Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump want those 10-year yields down to ease borrowing costs and the government’s monster debt burden, but the market’s like, “Nah, fam.” Yields are climbing despite the chaos—10-year’s above 4.10-4.20% again—because tariffs might juice inflation, and the Fed’s not rushing to cut rates (Powell’s sounding hawkish AF). Foreign investors aren’t piling into Treasuries like they used to either, maybe because faith in U.S. assets is shaky with all this tariff drama and political noise. China could even start dumping bonds as a trade war flex. Bottom line: markets are a mess, yields won’t behave, and this global trade showdown’s got everyone on edge. Thoughts?

9:45am - Market rally begins

9:53am - Hasset, on Fox news, responds to the question of 'Will you do a 90 day pause' with: ""Yeah... you know, the president is going to decide what the president's going to decide"".

10:00am - S&P locks in at the 5000 resistance level

10:10am - Fast rally into positive territory

10:13am - The supposed triggering tweet for this ""Fake News"" driven rally comes out

~10:15am - News outlets begin reporting the potential 90-day pause. 

10:17am - The rally peaks, and shortly after multiple stations begin reporting that a flash rally was caused by a ""Fake News"" mistake about a 90-day rally.

[Edit] [This article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/04/07/how-4-trillion-from-the-stock-market-in-minutes/) clearly shows the 10:13 (tweet) and 10:14 (CNBC) timestamps and that the rally was basically done by then. Combined with market action starting at 10:10, I feel this is definitive proof that neither were the actual originators of the misinformation. 

Some are claiming the fake news popped up on the Bloomberg terminals a few minutes prior, though I've yet to see any screenshots or timestamp of when that happened. While it would explain how we spiked a few minutes before the ""info"" went public, it brings all the more question as to how this was able to make it to the terminals, and who had this supposed news even earlier. In such a scenario, it's not simply some tweet causing a flash rise, but a much more (supposedly) reliable system that picked it up erroneously.

wallstreetbets,"That’s certainly the narrative that will be attached to what happened. But narratives are something that only happen after the fact. 

I want to know why the CME was down for so long today (or down at all, ffs). Everything was trading so janky in the morning. It’s almost as though they had to physically rip the plugs out of the walls to stop the algos from selling (short or otherwise) in the face of overwhelming bearish price action and sentiment…

And then by the time things miraculously got restored, price action was smooth, everything was range bound, and it was as if there was a cap on how much selling could take place no matter the headlines. Even now, with China escalating the trade war and literally zero positive news futures have rallied back to a “safe” zone that isn’t bordering on 2022 bear market territory. You want to see a sell off, breaking into the range of the 2022 bear market where so many people bought the dip would see a freaking sell off like no other. But I digress.

stocksandtrading,"For investing really any broker will work just pick one... I use Schwab/TOS. 

You should focus on etfs to get started.
Sp500 = VOO or VTI
Dividends = SCHD

Later you can add VXUS and BND and hold a little cash in TBIL. But when getting started focus on the top voo/vti and schd.

 If you starting with a very small account imo you should just focus on VTI and start building it up till you get a good chunk in there then start to focus on the rest.


As far as strategy just DCA, buy same amount at same interval. Example: buy 1 vti and 6 schd every month.. this like clockwork.

This is the easiest most failsafe way to invest in my opinion. Now you can decide to do it weekly quarterly however you choose... and also choose whatever amount you want.... the biggest thing is being consistent!!!

Right now is an excellent time to start! You can buy as the market is going down and get things on sale! 

Try not to focus on individual stocks until you learn how the market works... DCA into ETFs is the no worry easiest way to do it though!

This is a generalization I don't know your situation but depending on how much you have to get started it may be worth talking to a financial advisor... but if you talking just a few thousand dollars then getting started like stated above is a pretty standard way of investing. Once you start to build account size then it gets a little more involved.

stocksandtrading,"Thoroughly appreciate your complexity - I also think a hard and sad truth which seems to be lost on this Barnum wannabe and his cadre of clowns in this circus we’re calling an “Administration” is that the American people lost their calluses decades ago. That’s not to say they’re aren’t hard working Americans performing respectable blue collar work - I have one of those blue collar manufacturing jobs myself, and the trades arguably need a strong revival - but instead to highlight the fact that the US Economy experienced a wholesale shift into services and tech in the run up to 2008. What was left of real American manufacturing never recovered, and that comes at the hand of the question - how many Americans are lining up for an entry level position stitching blue jeans together? Who really wants to pick fruit in the fields? I’m not putting down anyone working in these fields, again I work in manufacturing. Yet loving or hating illegal immigration is beside the point, and that was the only large population which has consistently been willing to do those jobs. 

It’s why we spent the past 3 decades finding a less expensive and more consistent work force to keep this all going. Florida lost its entire agricultural workforce when ICE moved in a few months ago and those farmers aren’t recovering well. Their best “idea” to date is child labor. Unfortunately that extends far into the northern states and farms all around the country are wondering how they’ll manage this years harvest ( and that’s ignoring the decimation of financial programs and subsidies which kept them afloat ). This is just a very dismal situation and I’m disappointed that more Americans couldn’t have seen the writing on the wall. Complexity isn’t a vice but it feels like this country is high on its own supply. 

This is also ignoring that a services economy essentially runs on goodwill and “friendships”. Why would another country use our services like consulting, marketing, data analytics, cybersecurity, or our general tech offerings after we’ve spit in their face? Was the DeepSeek debacle so long ago that we truly believe other countries can’t rise to the challenge and perform these services with equal or greater outcomes? It’s a ridiculous show of American exceptionalism, one that will have us all go broke in the long run.

More people should read and write posts like yours - posts which acknowledge the multi-faceted nature of things like tariff policy - yet we live in the world of “own the libs!” And “why shouldn’t trade policy be fair?!”.

stocksandtrading,"No, I do not think buying now is wise. The market has shown no evidence that buyers are regaining control. On the contrary, Friday was a brutal “sell everything” day.

It is very high risk to go long in this environment, except for regularly scheduled DCA into index funds in long-term accounts where the money will not be needed for at least 5 years.

“Cheap” can become “ridiculously cheap.” I will not be putting new money to work until one of the following:

- The S&P 500 finds support at an area of interest based on past prices, such as the high of the bull market before the 2022 bear market began. This level is around 4800-4900. It also coincides with the longer term trend from the COVID bear market lows. Even if we reach this area, I will not buy until there are signs of buyers gaining control by making a big bounce and starting to trend upward again. If this should happen intraday and then bounce hard off the level, then I would consider a sizable long investment but use a stop loss below the low of the day. This is how capitulation often occurs, similar to August 5, 2024.

- The market stops bleeding and starts moving higher and starts making higher highs and higher lows including at least one day of a big surge on high volume. This could indicate sellers are exhausted. However, without a real capitulation low, there will still be considerable risk of sellers regaining control again and therefore I would monitor this position closely and get out at the first sign that we are rolling over again.

While chances are S&P is near an intermediate low, there’s no reason it cannot keep going lower, even slicing through that 4800-4900 area. If that should occur, then I believe there would be very high risk of an ongoing bear market that could ultimately take us much lower. The 3600 area on SPX would be the next potential major support. That would be around a 40% bear market, which has happened many times before and can easily happen again if Mr. President doesn’t back off from these tactics that are likely to do irreparable damage to the world economy and willingness of trade partners to continue to rely on the US as a stable partner.",think buying wise market shown evidence buyer regaining control contrary friday brutal sell everything day high risk go long environment except regularly scheduled dca index fund long term account money needed least year cheap become ridiculously cheap putting new money work one following p find support area interest based past price high bull market bear market began level around also coincides longer term trend covid bear market low even reach area buy sign buyer gaining control making big bounce starting trend upward happen intraday bounce hard level would consider sizable long investment use stop loss low day capitulation often occurs similar august market stop bleeding start moving higher start making higher high higher low including least one day big surge high volume could indicate seller exhausted however without real capitulation low still considerable risk seller regaining control therefore would monitor position closely get first sign rolling chance p near intermediate low reason cannot keep going lower even slicing area occur believe would high risk ongoing bear market could ultimately take u much lower area spx would next potential major support would around bear market happened many time easily happen mr president back tactic likely irreparable damage world economy willingness trade partner continue rely u stable partner,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

I think this quarter GDP will be okay, lower than last but not awful. I am betting the following quarter will be negative. Two consecutive negative quarters equals a recession, so we might be in one by 2026 and that seems very likely at this point. If that becomes a reality, the market will head to the bottom. If the tariffs happen prices will go up and we'll have more inflation. Inflation during a recession is called ""stagflation"" and it's hard hole to get out of. We had that from 1973 until the early '80s and it was very painful. If we don't have a trade war, just threats of one, consumer prices are still going to increase as companies prepare for the unknown which will erode GDP and unemployment will go up but it may not as bad or it may not last as long.

The forecast includes adjusted earnings of $2.30 per share on revenue of $7.1 billion, slightly below analysts' projections.

Analysts have expressed varied perspectives: Goldman Sachs maintains a positive outlook with a price target of $230, citing potential growth from technological shifts in the semiconductor industry.
 Conversely, Morgan Stanley downgraded AMAT to 'Underweight,' lowering the price target to $164, due to concerns over near-term market conditions.

stocksandtrading,"Real estate is stupid. AI will dilute it, people will spread away from city centers and build more, you're better off investing in the AI related value drivers that will capture more of everything per year. Human individuals have less and less money for many reasons.  You're investing in an asset with no long term prospects because human labor eventually gets diluted and before then?  Outsourced.  The few folks that get outsourced to that H1B or work visa in to this system need bigger homes to share with like ten families to afford to sustain it, which would look differently from the current immigration picture. (Although H1Bs likely make more with rarer skills e.g. AI/DS).

In my book INTZ>INTC, undervalued during a time where I don't see any CHIPS or other propping up Intel, which has serious problems.

Their fab is still in Taiwan (when you read Taiwan put your grasses on and you will see Tariffs) so they'll be getting spanked until policies that actually make that fab relocate are created and implemented.

That might even be temporarily sustainable through debeers-like artificial scarcity.  That will still invite greater competition however, as the payoff of fab construction would spike (as with SPL reserve emptying setting a floor, but less intense and probably not enough to move fab on its own).

Most likely that would be a policy which ties security to tranches of relocated top tier fab.  I expect as much.

stocksandtrading,"Lets tackle this ignorance 1 step at a time.

1) Cartels: The war on drugs made them rich (Republican Push). The Continued resistance against legalizing drugs continues to make them rich (Mostly republicans). Now, we will spend more money ""fighting"" them, and they will get even richer... Because of republicans. See a common theme? 

1a) He spoke about not getting into wars we don't need to be. This is a prime one. Plus, see #5. Military spending is one of the most significant discretionary budgets we dump billions annually.

2) protecting borders: 80+% of illegal immigrants in the US have Visa Overstays dating back before 2010. A vast majority of ""illegal immigrants"" that currently are talked about aren't illegal immigrants. They are asylum seekers awaiting their adjudication on granting or returning them. And the US law prohibits them from working for 6M after they arrive. Additionally, most of the border crossers are collected and returned to Mexico, like 90+%. Our border isn't defenseless... nor is it the sieve Republicans make it out to be. 

2a) He's already walked back his ""Raids"" to only target those who are a threat to national security and good law and order. His INS/BP pick already said they aren't after the ones here living and working... Just the ones breaking the law. Which is already INS's mandate. So this is nothing new. He's spinning it to make it look like he's doing something. BTW, even if we do this, it will cost HUNDREDS of BILLIONS to do even the bare minimum... see #5.

3) DEI vs. Merit. The assumption is that people are being promoted purely on DEI statistics, which isn't the case. The only time DEI applies is when all else is equal. In the cases where this happens, which I'm sure it does, it probably has less to do with DEI and more to do with who they know. A bureaucracy is a giant rat race, and who you know is more important than anything else.

4) Government employees work; they've never worked as efficiently as the private sector, but then again, most union employees generally work at a different speed. Every metric (Private and public sector) shows a positive trend in efficiency and throughput when employees can work from home. Hundreds of studies across multiple nations in every sector of the economy bear this out. 

4a) This will also require them to reopen mothballed buildings that were shut down (and in some cases had the leases ended or the property sold), costing millions per building. Again, see #5

5) Republicans have never cut spending. Trump didn't cut spending in his first term. In fact, per capita, he outspent every other president, including Biden. He added more to the national deficit (overall) than any single-term president before him (even adjusting for inflation).

6) You didn't say it, but it's important to acknowledge. The vast majority of what Trump is talking about is massive government overreach, which he then rails against a few statements later. The juxtaposition of the two ideals is insane! He is talking about granting freedoms and immediately talks about removing them. 

Lastly, as a veteran and a student of history, his concept of the military is inane babble. The US Military has been the testing ground for social equity FOREVER. Women in leadership, Forced Integration, and dozens of other areas of civilian life were first MANDATED in the military. It has been the litmus test for every major social change in the last 200 years...

stocksandtrading,"I'd suggest putting your money into a global (or S&P 500) index fund or ETF while you do some research and learning. Most people, even professional fund managers on average rarely outperform a simple index fund over the long term.  Some are lucky for a while, and you can sometimes pick the right stock and get extra returns, but the risk you take by not being diversified (spread among different stocks/asset classes) can be invisible until it happens - for example Nvidia looks great and has returned mega percentages, but it's possible that it could go down almost overnight. Nobody knows the future.

Everything looks great when the market does well and it's easy to make money (like the last few years), but every so often there is a big crash and stocks will drop massively. Most people think that's possibly overdue, but this might be a day, a week, a month, or several years away.  This is the 'risk' part of 'your capital is at risk'.

Beware of anyone offering or selling advice, training, tips, 'get rich quick' schemes. The biggest red flag: If I had a working system/trick/prediction method, why would I be selling courses rather than sipping champagne  on my yacht? Is it because I make more money selling courses than I do with the system (i.e. the system doesn't work reliably).

Most trading/stock apps have a 'practice mode' where you can learn using pretend money. Use it!  Be very careful with your investments, start very small - you may lose it all - and be defensive. YOLO'ing a grand into a penny stock might give you a 'potential huge return', but you've probably got better odds putting it all on black at the casino.

Stay away from options!  Unless you understand exactly what you are doing you can easily wipe out your entire account with a single mistake. I fuck up regularly, there is no way I'm betting on myself to execute hundreds of trades perfectly without a single brain-fart.",suggest putting money global p index fund etf research learning people even professional fund manager average rarely outperform simple index fund long term lucky sometimes pick right stock get extra return risk take diversified spread among different stock asset class invisible happens example nvidia look great returned mega percentage possible could go almost overnight nobody know future everything look great market well easy make money like last year every often big crash stock drop massively people think possibly overdue might day week month several year away risk part capital risk beware anyone offering selling advice training tip get rich quick scheme biggest red flag working system trick prediction method would selling course rather sipping champagne yacht make money selling course system e system work reliably trading stock apps practice mode learn using pretend money use careful investment start small may lose defensive yolo ing grand penny stock might give potential huge return probably got better odds putting black casino stay away option unless understand exactly easily wipe entire account single mistake fuck regularly way betting execute hundred trade perfectly without single brain fart,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

In the current secondary market, chips are no longer the most favored AI investment target. Instead, the spotlight has shifted to AI applications. The U.S. stock market's ""AI+"" trend is producing an increasing number of standout performers.

Recently, AI application stock $**Applovin (APP.US)** reached a new all-time high, with its stock price surging over 850% year-to-date and a market cap exceeding $100 billion, continuing to fuel the AI narrative. Meanwhile, **Palantir (PLTR.US)**, known for its ""AI+Defense"" focus, has also risen an impressive 318% this year.

According to Menlovc data, overall enterprise AI spending has grown from $2.3 billion last year to $13.8 billion this year. While foundational models remain the largest area of expenditure, spending on model deployment and application layers is accelerating at a faster pace.

stocksandtrading,"I started investing almost exactly a year ago and I’ve made just over $2k (~30%) from mostly safe ETF investments, and one lucky play with DJT. Most of my portfolio is in VFV (same as VOO just in CAD) and XEQT. VFV is a fund that invests in the S&P 500, which has consistently performed very well. XEQT invests in similar US markets, but is also a lot more diversified across Canadian markets as well as other international markets. This means that if the US market takes a hit, XEQT will tend to preserve its value better because it’s being propped up by international markets. HXQ is another good one that invests in US tech stocks and has also performed well historically. CASH.TO is a great safe way to make guaranteed tax free income at a fixed rate. It’s basically a high interest savings account in the form of a mutual fund on the stock market. 

If you want to keep your funds available to withdraw, stick to a TFSA rather than a retirement saving account. You can withdraw from a TFSA at any time without paying any fees or taking tax penalties.

stocksandtrading,"great advice from other comment. Research what your interests are. Is it healthcare, retail, manufacturing, technology? After researching a company and you can confidently say, this company will have ""future growth"" then start from there. See if the stock has had good earnings/revenue. Stocks in the stock exchange are required to publicly show there earnings quarterly. once you look at its fundamentals and you think it still has future growth and its not slowing down, cause that can cause a sell off. see if its currently overbought, see its history all time past and research a bit on why it dipped on particular days or not and try to buy on a red day when overall market is down. see if insiders who work for the company are selling or buying shares. if you believe in a stock sometimes you have to hold and wait for earnings for all other investors to believe and have proof the company is doing good, there can be hype in between the earnings that drives market prices a lot of stock can drop or gain just on the news and silly stuff sometimes pure emotions and not fundamentals. I google stocks all the time why did this stock dip today. sometimes stocks even dip on good earnings and there's usually an answer like investors where expected a 15% revenue and it was 5% or something. sometimes people sell expecting a dip or wait for a dip that doesn't come also and they lose out on a large gain. There can be a CEO change or new laws placed, trump can decide one day to increase taxes on foreign imports and those stocks will go down. Also if a stock does go down and researched why and you still believe in it you can invest more into a dip to lower your overall in. or just hold or sell cause you found a better stock but overall holding for a long time does better then timing the market and those people seem to make more also ask google if you think it will beat the S&P 500 which is the top 500 stocks like voo.

Especially if you are young like under 55, you have lots of time to grow your investments.  Then after owning 500 companies in an ETF if you really want to buy some stocks, read a few books on it and start with low risk companies that have decent value.  Blue chip companies that you actually use on a daily basis is where I started.  Walmart, Apple, Netflix, Meta, Google, etc.  People used to say whatever is in your cupboard at home.  Again its not as exciting as seeing crypto jump around with all its highs and lows, but it's much better in the long term.",crystal ball stock investing high risk high risk started investing p would doubled money know boring think long term especially young like lot time grow investment owning company etf really want buy stock read book start low risk company decent value blue chip company actually use daily basis started walmart apple netflix meta google etc people used say whatever cupboard home exciting seeing crypto jump around high low much better long term,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
stocksandtrading,"Either you have to decide to invest which requires holding on to companies that you like essentially forever, or you swing trade them weekly to monthly based on actual strategy around market movement including news. At which point you shouldn't care what the company is more about what's happening. However if you're not good at trading then stop trading buy into the s&p or a specific sector. Next by dividend stocks, and continue to invest regardless of what happens in the market and hold it for the rest of your life. Market has always gone up over time but it's a principle of not thinking about it and buying constantly. If you still wish to trade I don't think there's anything wrong with it like most people are suggesting you need to focus on a strategy and stick with that strategy and don't trade unless you see your strategy working out. Even if it means you start out only making one trade a week. Trading over years doesn't make sense most people that trade usually try to day trade or swing positions over longer periods like weeks or months.

**As a general rule: ""NEVER"" EXERCISE YOUR LONG CALL!**   
A common beginner's mistake stems from the belief that exercising is the only way to realize a gain on a long call. It is not. Sell to close is the best way to realize a gain, almost always.       
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling retrieves.**   
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, to harvest value, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your break-even is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

**[Monday School: Exercise and Expiration are not what you think they are.](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m5r8mi/monday_school_exercise_and_expiration_are_not/)**    

**As another general rule, don't hold option trades through expiration.**

Expiration introduces complex risks that can catch you by surprise. Here is just one [horror story](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ipqkua/fridays_tsla_lesson_close_positions_before/) of an expiration surprise that could have been avoided if the trade had been closed before expiration.

options,">If I buy a put contract for $3 a share but opt to sell the contract for $4 a share before expiration, am I now on the hook for the 100 shares if the person who bought my sold contract exercises the contract? Or am I in the clear and walk away with $100 in my pocket.

No, you're in the clear.

>Just trying to understand who's on the hook for the shares. Person A: is the originator of the Put contract Person B (me): who spent $300 on their put contract If I execute the option then Person A is on the hook to buy 100 shares at the strike price.

>However if I ""flip"" my contract to a Person C and Person C executes the option then am I on the hook for the 100 shares or did I just transfer ownership of Person A's contract to Person C and Person A is still on the hook for the 100 shares, and I am sort of middle man with minimal risk?

The thing is, there really are no persons A, B, and C because there is no ""the"" contract.  It's not like when person A sells to open, a unique contract with serial #A183467B9 is created which person B is then holding, so that when person B sells to person C, they are transferring ownership of contract #A183467B9.  For one thing, person C could be buying to close, so what would then become of that contract?

It's really more like each brokerage maintains a big list of all their clients and how many contracts of each option they are long and short.  So Schwab has a list saying ""Joe Smith is short 3 ABC 4/11 50 strike puts, Frank Jones is long 4 XYZ 4/21 60 strike calls calls,"" etc.  Then the OCC has a master list of each brokerage and how many clients each one has that are long or short each contract.  When someone who is long a QRS 4/18 45 strike put exercises, the OCC picks a brokerage at random to assign someone, then that brokerage picks someone at random who is short a 4/18 45 strike put and assigns them.",buy put contract share opt sell contract share expiration hook share person bought sold contract exercise contract clear walk away pocket clear trying understand hook share person originator put contract person b spent put contract execute option person hook buy share strike price however flip contract person c person c executes option hook share transfer ownership person contract person c person still hook share sort middle man minimal risk thing really person b c contract like person sell open unique contract serial b created person b holding person b sell person c transferring ownership contract b one thing person c could buying close would become contract really like brokerage maintains big list client many contract option long short schwab list saying joe smith short abc strike put frank jones long xyz strike call call etc occ master list brokerage many client one long short contract someone long qrs strike put exercise occ pick brokerage random assign someone brokerage pick someone random short strike put assigns,Comment,['SCHW'],Banks & Finance

If your thesis is correct and it causes the SPY to drop a little below $500, then, yes, this would be a good idea.

A few questions though:

The market is aware of the potential results of these tariffs and is pricing it into the current value of all the stocks that compose the S&P 500. Do you have some knowledge about the tariffs that the market doesn't?

Also, do you think that if China doesn't back down that the surprise would be significant enough to drop the SPY below 500?",guy think buy dollar spy put expiring thesis correct cause spy drop little yes would good idea question though market aware potential result tariff pricing current value stock compose p knowledge tariff market also think china back surprise would significant enough drop spy,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

options,"You’re just discovering a strategy that’s very widely common and well known, albeit very basic. The gotchas are that usually if it drops to the price you want to enter at there’s a reason for the drop, and will most likely be a material change that will make you question whether it was ever the right decision to enter at *that* particular price. But that’s a separate issue.

Additionally you’ll have to be comfortable with the mental battle you’ll fight with yourself for those periods when the underlying stock price is climbing rapidly as the gains from your put premiums will continually diminish (as the stock price increases the Δ, or change, in the price of the puts you’ve sold gets smaller and smaller as their price approaches $0), so the limited upside is also something you’ll have to be comfortable with—it’s the tradeoff for taking a smaller risk by trying to enter at a lower price.

If you’re going to pursue this strategy however, it works best to sell puts that are 30-45 days away from expiring. In the last 30 days of an option’s life cycle before expiry, theta decay (the value of an option’s premium built in that depends on the amount of time remaining until it expires) is highest, so as a seller you want time to go by quickly so that (ideally) the option expires worthless and you aren’t assigned, and can repeat the process again.

A couple of nuances about the strategy:

Very often it can be treated as a lower risk long position if it’s actively managed in a volatile market, like what we have now. Very often a trader will sell the put and close the position once it loses 50% of its value rather than waiting for it to go to $0. This isn’t a rule you yourself *have* to follow, it’s just what many do because they would rather have 50% gain and then move on to what may be another better opportunity rather than hold a long period of time for 100% and then possibly have all of their capital tied up in one position. Again, it’s a matter of preference and goals. If you do t have the time to manage the position or it’s an underlying you’re really trying to enter a position in, your goals and objectives will be different than someone who is maybe just trying to execute an income strategy and has the resources/time to manage positions actively.

The second nuance of course is that very often this strategy does require a percentage of the underlying principal to be held in reserve by your broker as collateral for the purchase of the shares should your option get exercised by whoever bought it from you. For some people this is capital inefficient, as they might be able to replicate the position using calls without the needed additional capital. But again this depends on the volatility of the underlying, the time management and resources each investor has to manage the positions, as well as their long term view.

But, again, it’s a widely known strategy that is the first leg of “the wheel.” r/thewheel would be a good community for you to join. The wheel involves selling a put in an underlying you would like to take ownership of at the price you are willing to enter it at, repeating this process of selling puts until you are exercised and forced to buy, and then selling covered calls (cc) against your long stock position to generate additional revenue until it rises in price past the strike of the call and you are forced to sell it away. There’s a lot of success to the strategy, and I encourage you to make an Excel sheet that goes back 4 years and to then look at how well you would have done over that period as opposed to owning the stock. Use a consistent rule like “I will sell the put at x% below current market price,” and then use the price of the puts 30 days out to determine how much premium you collect as well as whether or not you would have been forces to buy 30 days later. Then on the periods where you would have been assigned, see how much premium would have been collected from selling calls 30 days out. Compare the result to what it would have been to simply own the stock and you’ll get an idea.

options,"Yesterday's triumph of narrative over foundations taught me an important lesson about the market: it doesn't matter what reality says. So long as any piece of good news is expressed by a sufficiently loud mouth, the overall trend of the real economy is immaterial to the day-to-day swings of the market. It matters in the long-term, but not the short--and short is where the greatest risks/rewards live.

Tomorrow, JPM and WFC will announce their quarterly earnings, with EPS and revenue *generally* expected by analysts to be favorable relative to Q1 2024. Everyone also expects remarks about tariffs being bad for the future, which will not matter because it's already common knowledge and has already been priced in.

I fully expect a morning post from TruthSocial's largest account during or before market opening. The post will exaggerate the strength of the financial system in light of these reports and urge everyone to invest in the economy; hints about impending trade deals with tariffed countries will also be present.

This will send the bulls into a frenzy, which we should capitalize on with short-term calls on SPY, JPM, WFC, and the tech giants. For SPY specifically, I'll go just OTM relative to where the market opens, which will certainly be higher than today's closing position. I don't know whether a stampede comparable to Wednesday's will materialize, but I am fairly certain that bullish activity will happen.

1. Tariffs Are a Margin Killer – Supply Chain’s a House of Cards

""Made in USA"" Disaster: Trump’s push to reshore iPhone production could spike costs by 15-20% (JPMorgan estimate). China’s ecosystem of suppliers – from Foxconn’s assembly lines to BOE’s displays – can’t be replicated in Arizona factories overnight.

Triple Tariff Threat: Proposed 25% tariffs on imports from China, Vietnam, and India (where 30% of Apple’s suppliers operate) would crush margins. iPhones currently bank on 22.5% gross margins – these tariffs alone could slash that to 18%.

Consumer Backlash: Pass 10-15% price hikes to buyers? Good luck competing with Samsung’s Vietnam-made Galaxy S26 priced 20% lower.

2. Innovation Flatline – iPhones Are Yesterday’s News

iPhone Growth Stagnation: <3% sales growth through 2026 (Gartner forecast). The ""Siri 2.0"" flop and delayed iPhone 17 (now pushed to 2026 per Ming-Chi Kuo) leave zero excitement. Gen-Z’s ditching iPhones for Humane AI Pins and Rabbit R1s.

Services in the Crosshairs:

EU’s $5B Antitrust Fine: Forces Apple to cut App Store fees to 15% (from 30%), gutting services revenue growth (currently 22% of total).

Regulatory Domino Effect: U.S. DOJ lawsuit looming – a breakup of Apple’s hardware-services bundle could vaporize $120B in market cap (Goldman Sachs model).

options,"Not until they punch through 86. If this truly is a “nuclear winter” for international trade, it’s coming. But just understand that VIX structure is not like any other structure, and the premium built into puts on an index built on puts is not perfectly straightforward. The timing and strike has to be perfect—for example, today the VIX closed at 48ish which of course implies a very high volatility environment, so something like a 47 put on the VIX that expires tomorrow might be trading for $7.50–so they’re relatively very expensive as a rule simply because of the extreme volatility built into their pricing structure as a result of being a derivative of volatility itself. It’s almost always better to be a seller of put premium with the VIX than a buyer. Conversely, it’s usually a better strategy to buy way otm calls as opposed to selling call premium in a low volatility environment.

That doesn’t mean you can’t make money, but even with almost no theta premium built in, you need VIX to fall from 48 to 40 tomorrow just to break even. Throw in the fact that usually the price doesn’t collapse until the very end of the day when it’s clear where it will end up and it makes for a trade setup fraught with emotional dangers to cut early at a small loss, hold on too long and lose the whole position, etc. It takes some real experience trading VIX options to get it right, so I wouldn’t encourage it unless you have a real strategy that is back tested and worth relying on. There’s so many better ways to play a snap rally like what we had today than VIX put options.

I remember there was a guy back in 2007 who built his entire advisory portfolio around hedging Black Swan events using VIX calls that were long dated and extremely far out of the money. He was one of the few who was profitable during the GFC; although over periods of growth he underperformed the market, during the crash the premium he paid as part of his strategy saved him the losses that everyone else incurred and it all balanced out for his results over the long term. I remember it being interesting because his clients were fine knowing they would underperform in exchange for stability in a stormy market.

Anyway, it’s usually better to buy calls ahead of the crash and sell puts. Conversely, it’s generally very expensive to do it the other way around once the fire starts to catch; premium in both calls and puts is very high simply because of the expectation that VIX will have large moves in a very volatile market.

As a final note, a VIX value of 48 implies a 30-day move of 716 points on the S&P—contrary to popular misconception that doesn’t mean 716 points down, it implies a move in either direction. So, we’ve done that in just a few days easily, meaning more than likely the VIX is underestimating the potential price movement we’ll see over the next month, so if you’re determined on VIX puts there’s a high probability you’ll see higher VIX prints before it really comes down meaningfully in anyway that invites a good value proposition from a risk/reward standpoint. 

The number I’m looking for is 86. We hit 89 in 2007 right before the second vote on TARP after Congress $h17 their bed when the markets collapsed because they failed to get a package put together the first time, and we hit 82 during Covid with the oil prices going negative for that brief period of time.

This isn’t 2007. Yet. So if we can’t punch into at least the 70’s by the end of the week, more than likely the market will have accepted that there is some form of resolution or basis for anchoring onto a floor. We’ll see, volatile markets make for huge opportunities, but caution is always warranted, especially when you get stories intentionally leaked to try and move a primed market wildly for someone who is lined up waiting for the reaction, like what happened today.

https://i.imgur.com/I1hg7Da.png

> For S&P 500 futures (like the E-mini S&P 500 futures - ES) during non-U.S. trading hours (typically 5:00 p.m. CT to 8:30 a.m. CT, Sunday through Friday), the circuit breaker mechanism is different from the market-wide circuit breakers that align with the cash equity market.

>Here's how it works during these off-hours:

>    7% Price Limits: There are hard upside and downside price limits of 7% from the 3:00 p.m. CT futures fixing price. This means trading cannot occur more than 7% above or below that reference price during these hours.

>    Dynamic Circuit Breakers: Additionally, Dynamic Circuit Breakers are in effect with a width of 3.5%. If the contract market moves beyond +/- 3.5% within a rolling one-hour window, trading will be paused for two minutes.

> Key Differences from Regular Trading Hours:

>    The off-hours circuit breaker is based on a fixed percentage move from the previous day's fixing price, not the market-wide S&P 500 index levels.
>    There are both upside and downside limits (7%), whereas the regular hours circuit breakers are triggered by downside moves in the S&P 500.
>    The dynamic circuit breaker introduces short pauses based on rapid price movements within a shorter timeframe.

> In summary, the circuit breaker for S&P 500 futures during off-hour trading primarily involves a 7% price limit and a 3.5% dynamic circuit breaker that can trigger a 2-minute trading halt.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-04-11.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

Trump probably wanted China to play ball but they retaliated pretty hard. 


We won't know the effect of these tariffs in a macro-economic sense until Q2 reports which is a couple months away.

The problem you’ll run into now though, is: why would it come down on Monday or any time this week? Implied volatility for the market will remain high because the amount of uncertainty isn’t about to vanish when at any given time the tariff situation can change… about 180 countries received US tariffs and are due to comment/respond to that. Earnings reports for banks are coming as well on Friday, including JPM and WFC (also MS and UNTY)… those banks will inform us indirectly about where inflation is heading based on their plans/guidance. More directly, the CPI report is out this Thursday, which will overshadow the bank reports along with the tariffs… A lot of unknowns are on the horizon still… 

The chance of VIX going up further isn’t that low given these facts. But it isn’t clear anymore whether it goes up or down from here or for how long. Not a safe short term investment for either direction this week.

options,"Alright, let’s address exactly what’s confusing this Reddit user and explain the mechanics of what’s happening under the hood of these futures options positions.

TL;DR – Why This Trader Is Seeing “100% Profit” on a Straddle

The Redditor is running straddle positions on futures options (e.g., /ES and /NG), and is confused that:
	•	One side is deep in-the-money (ITM),
	•	The other side is out-of-the-money (OTM) or zero,
	•	Yet they’re somehow showing a full 100% gain on the straddle.

They’re asking: “How can both sides be profitable when only one side is ITM? Shouldn’t the other be losing?”

Key Reasons This Is Happening

1. You’re Trading Futures Options, Not Equity Options
	•	Futures options are cash-settled, marked-to-market daily, and have different Greeks behavior—especially on thinly traded or illiquid contracts.
	•	Unlike equity options, the moment one leg goes deeply ITM, your margin requirement and risk premium drops dramatically, effectively showing as “realized” or “100% profit” in some platforms.
	•	Many brokers mark the position’s value to maximum profit potential early, especially in paper accounts.

2. Option Leg Marking Behavior Can “Cap” the Loss Display
	•	The ITM put (e.g., 5450P on /ES) is showing $4,050 profit.
	•	The OTM call (5200C) is showing $10,162.50 profit, which seems weird if SPX is trading around 5096.

This looks like a **combo of:
	•	wide bid/ask spreads,
	•	deep ITM margin credit being reflected as closed profit,
	•	and unrealistic marking of OTM premium to zero**.

So even if the call is OTM, the put value is dominating the net delta.
Your net straddle is profitable, and the platform just assumes the trade is “done.”

3. In Futures Options, ITM Positions Settle Like Futures

If you’re 300 points ITM on an S&P futures put (like the 5450P vs. 5096 current price), you’ve already absorbed most of the directional movement. If the broker marks that at full intrinsic, you’ll show a full profit—even though the other leg isn’t offsetting.

So even a straddle can show +100% net if:
	•	The ITM leg is that deep
	•	The OTM leg has decayed or isn’t dragging
	•	And your fills were favorable or cash-settled

Why This Isn’t a Bug (Even in Paper Trading)
	•	Futures options are less intuitive than equity options.
	•	Most retail brokers simulate close-to-intrinsic values for ITM options nearing expiration.
	•	Paper trading environments often ignore slippage, spreads, and volatility crush—leading to exaggerated “perfect world” gains.

Real Example in Your Case (/ES)
	•	You’re short the 5450 Put (now deep ITM) → That position alone should be massively profitable.
	•	You’re also short the 5200 Call (now OTM) → This should be nearly worthless, showing no drag.

But because your ITM put absorbed so much directional move (SPX dropped below 5096), it swallowed the straddle, giving you full credit.

Final Notes
	•	This is normal in futures options with wide strikes and aggressive delta.
	•	On real accounts, you’d see more realistic marking due to spread/wiggle room.
	•	You’re not broken—the system’s just showing the net economic value across multiple unusual mechanics.

options,"Here’s a clean breakdown of this new thread (tied to the futures options confusion from earlier), with signal, nonsense, and actual value extracted.

Thread Context:

OP is confused how a deep ITM option on /NG (Natural Gas) is showing massive profit—even though it feels like the position isn’t “moving” or he isn’t managing it.

Comment-by-Comment Breakdown

1. A_Dragon (OP)

	“Somehow this AI-generated response was partially helpful.”

Meta: Likely referring to our earlier breakdown (which nailed the ITM/Vega/margin mechanics).
Signal: OP is still seeking more tactile understanding—especially around why no active management still yields gains.

2. Gemaneye

	“The 50 and 200 MA might provide part of the answer.”

Flawed:
	•	Irrelevant in this context. OP is asking about futures options mechanics, not price trend signals.
	•	Moving averages don’t explain premium marking, Vega decay, or margin compression.

3. A_Dragon (OP reply)

	“What does moving average have to do with this?”

Correct Pushback:
	•	OP is right to reject this. He’s focused on mechanical behavior of ITM options—MA is a misapplied concept here.

4. CactusMonkey12

	“Trading /NG = unprotected sex with strangers, Russian roulette…”

Comedic but true-ish:
	•	Natural Gas (/NG) is one of the most volatile futures contracts.
	•	This user is flagging that the product itself has wild swings and poor liquidity in its options market, which can exaggerate delta moves or lead to unexpected P/L behavior.

Signal:
	•	Reinforces that paper trading /NG options isn’t intuitive—even experienced traders get whiplashed by how it behaves.

5. A_Dragon (OP again)

	“It’s just paper trading… managing 30 delta spreads… somehow working out.”

Good Self-Awareness:
	•	OP’s strategy is clearer now: he’s trading short spreads (possibly short strangles or credit spreads) targeting ~30 delta.

Hidden Insight:
	•	He’s experiencing passive profit because:
	•	His short legs are decaying (Theta gain),
	•	Market stayed within expected range (no forced adjustments),
	•	He sold into elevated IV, which is now compressing (Vega profit).

Key Explanation for OP’s Confusion (If You’re OP or Similar)

Your deep ITM option is profitable because:
	1.	Futures options get marked daily and settle intraday.
	2.	When a strike gets deep ITM, it behaves almost like the underlying future, but with lower margin drag.
	3.	Your paper account likely doesn’t model bid/ask friction, so it’s showing the perfect world P/L.
	4.	You’re probably profiting from:
	•	Theta decay on short legs,
	•	Delta drift on long ITM leg,
	•	Vega compression (IV came down).

options,">I am missing something, or is that just delayed to be reflected on Monday?

Yes, the you'll start seeing changes in price on Monday.

Regarding the price of calls when the VIX goes up:

The VIX is negatively correlated with the S&P 500. If the VIX went up significantly, that generally means that the S&P 500 probably went down significantly too (the performance of the S&P 500 usually drives the VIX).

So, yes, the IV of calls may go up when the VIX goes up, but the effect of the S&P 500 going down is more important to call options.

Also: I should note that the VIX is a weighted sum of OTM calls and OTM puts. It's theoretically possible for the prices of puts to increase significantly without the price of calls moving. In this case, the VIX would still go up.",missing something delayed reflected monday yes start seeing change price monday regarding price call vix go vix negatively correlated p vix went significantly generally mean p probably went significantly performance p usually drive vix yes iv call may go vix go effect p going important call option also note vix weighted sum otm call otm put theoretically possible price put increase significantly without price call moving case vix would still go,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

options,"Think of options trading as multi-dimensional. It's not even 2D- learn the Greeks and you'll get it. 

In reality trading futures, or even just buying and selling stocks, is 2D. 

Look at your chart. There is an x axis, time. And a y axis, price. So in reality you've already got 2 variables- and the graph can be considered time-price. 2 variables, right? 

Options value also includes derivatives of time-price (by that I mean the mathematical term). You might think, oh, I'm just going to enter a short position by buying a 0dte (days to expire) put. Well, the value of your position will decay through the day as the expiration approaches- not because price went up, but because of theta. Theta is a measure of how the options contract price will change over time as time approaches the expiration. You can end up losing money, even if you got the direction of movement for the underlying stock right. And note that the value of your option contract doesn't even appear on the time-price graph of the stock at all- it has its own chart. Furthermore, there is an entire chain of these values, depending on how far in or out of the money your contract is- each with its own set of Greeks. 

Another example is delta. Delta is a measurement of how far the option price for a given contract at a particular stock time-price value is expected to change, given a constant (or scalar) change in the underlying (usually set as a 1 dollar change in the stock price). This number tells you if sentiment is bullish, bearish, or neutral- but here again, delta varies depending on where you are in time-price of the underlying, so both absolute price at a given time of that trading day, and time to expiry. You can also think of delta as a probability that the option will expire in the money. Gamma is the derivative value of delta with respect to the time to expiry. None of these are constant, and all of them need to be considered before opening a position. 

There are other Greeks, but I'm tired of typing. Go read some books on it. 

Now, consider trading a future contract, or buying/selling a stock- the idea is the same for those two. There's only one thing you gotta know: is the price going to go up, or down? If you think it's going to go up, buy - enter long. If you think it's going to go down, sell, or enter short. 

Here's the deal. You can spend years just trying to figure out a key phrase in the above paragraph: is the price going to go up, or down? How do you know that???? Starting off, it could just be a guess. Oh, the market is tanking, I'm just going to short. Easy, right? Welllllll ...... Not so fast. If you think that is easy..... Again, I guarantee you, you're gonna lose money. Just wait. Youll enter some position, the market will move in the other direction, and you won't know why- you'll close the position in a loss. Then, it'll turn out you were right after all and you'll kick yourself. Which leads me to the next point. 

The most important thing for any trader is RISK MANAGEMENT. You MUST figure that out! It's a lot easier to do with futures or buy/sell. You draw a line on the chart for your take profit point, and another line on the chart for a stop loss. (Where to put those lines is another shelf full of books you can read about....) Because you don't know the Greeks, you have zero chance of successful risk management in options. ZERO. and that is complicated further by your inexperience in just simply trading the underlying!

Trading from a cash account on, for example, Ninjatrader, you can short stocks or future contracts without having to own any of the stock. Futures are nice because there is a set amount of money you need for each contract in either direction. ES (this is the S&P) futures cost more per contract and have bigger potential for gains- but you can lose money quicker if you're wrong on the direction price is going to go. NQ contracts are cheaper, which is why I suggested them. And by the way, you cannot be margin called on futures if you don't trade with margin.... Some brokers allow it, but most require a minimum account size. Margin simply means you're borrowing money to trade; generally it allows you to enter a larger position size than you could otherwise, or it allows a trade to dip beneath your account balance in drawdown- to a point. If it gets too far in the red, that margin guy comes a callin', and he wants the negative amount to be repaid.... 

Before you can run, you must learn how to stand on your feet.

options,"**Friday, 4 April 2025, Short Bear Call Spread**

Hi all, entered a trade for fun today. Truth be told, I only ever DCA with index funds, and have very little experience outside of that. Would love to have your critique on this trade.

In case the screenshot's too small, here are the details

1pm: Shorted 1x 0DTE bear call spread for $1.40 credit. 

2pm: Bought back bear call spread for $1.85 debit; manual exit using limit order ($2.20) as there's seems to be no option to do a stop order on credit spreads in IBKR

Commissions: $1.91 per leg to open, $1.80 per leg to close

Total LOSS including: $52.52



This trade was taken during 

1) an overall market downtrend, hence I was looking for bearish trades

2) economic catalyst: trump went apeshit with liberation day, this was the 2nd day after liberation day

3) TA: price bounced at MA50 couple times before I entered, and I entered the trade in anticipation of a bounce.  



I exited at the time I did because:

1) Price has broken through all my marked price levels and/or dynamic support (MA), with nothing else in between the current price at that moment and the breakeven price of the bear call spread 

2) Given that there are no stop order options that I can find for credit spreads within IBKR, I was manually watching the P/L the whole time, with a mental stop of ""stop when P/L reaches loss of original credit (which is $140)"". At the point when I exited, P/L was bouncing wildly between -$90 and -$130, I figured that if I stuck around, things my just go south really quickly and my losses could very quickly exceed my mental figure of $140 



My questions are, 

1) Can someone really confirm that there is no way to do a stop order on credit spreads with IBKR?

2) Seeing how the trade went in my favor just minutes after I exited, and the fact that, had I stayed on, I probably would have kept all the credit my market closing, is there anything that I could have done better? 

3) My rationale for entry really wasn't well thought out, to be honest, but what should I be looking out for?",friday april short bear call spread hi entered trade fun today truth told ever dca index fund little experience outside would love critique trade case screenshot small detail pm shorted x dte bear call spread credit pm bought back bear call spread debit manual exit using limit order seems option stop order credit spread ibkr commission per leg open per leg close total loss including trade taken overall market downtrend hence looking bearish trade economic catalyst trump went apeshit liberation day nd day liberation day ta price bounced couple time entered entered trade anticipation bounce exited time price broken marked price level dynamic support nothing else current price moment breakeven price bear call spread given stop order option find credit spread within ibkr manually watching p l whole time mental stop stop p l reach loss original credit point exited p l bouncing wildly figured stuck around thing go south really quickly loss could quickly exceed mental figure question someone really confirm way stop order credit spread ibkr seeing trade went favor minute exited fact stayed probably would kept credit market closing anything could done better rationale entry really well thought honest looking,Body,['MA'],Banks & Finance
options,"Others answered the technical questions about contract prices and stops so I'll address the price action.

First of all, congrats on sticking to your stop strategy and exiting the trade as you planned.  That is one of the most difficult things to do, especially after seeing a trade go in your favor after exiting.  Does that mean your strategy was wrong?  It's impossible to tell based on one trade.  Sometimes that just happens and we have to accept it as an outcome.

Your thesis for selling a call spread was sound given the backdrop, although I'd argue you were a little late to the party if this was the only trade you took.  However there was still plenty of reason to get into the trade, although a little earlier might have benefited you more.

I personally trade price action and don't give too much credence to moving averages unless looking at a higher time frame.  I also don't know what your take profit plan was for this trade -- so I'll assume you were going to take profits at some point instead of just holding to expiration.  You've got levels marked pretty well on your chart, especially the 5162-ish level.  Just prior to 11:00 on your chart, there was a false breakdown of the level, a scary bullish bounce, but then a retest of it around 11:30, creating a pivot.  The weak bounce chopped a bit and then failed, and to me that failure of that 11:30 pivot would have told me to get ready to go short on a failure to reclaim that level.

Sure enough, it failed at 12:15, so now I would be looking to enter a short position (or sell your call spread) on the backtest of 5160-62, stopping out the trade if the level is reclaimed (meaning price moves above the level and flips it from resistance to support, turning the move into another false breakdown of that level).  Price rejected 5160 around 12:40, so I would have been in it.  This also coincides with a touch of one of your moving averages on the chart.  You can also draw a trendline from the top of the 11:18 candle to the 12:15 candle and see another intersection with this point.  These confluences give me higher confidence trades when they happen.

Had I *not* entered the trade already, the green candle and subsequent bounce at 12:51 would have given me pause as it didn't set a new low, and I probably wouldn't have gone for the trade personally.  Your entry after the MA rejection was OK, as it coincided with  the sloping trendline I mentioned earlier, and the trade eventually did break down the 5129 level and head lower.

Here's where it gets tricky.  Price swept the 5120 low set at 10:50, reversed just above 5100 (a key put gamma level -- basically a place where a lot of long puts were about to go ITM - and mass closure of those puts causes price to move up), moved above the ~~5210~~ 5120, and then back-tested it -- turning it into a support.  This would signal to me that a bounce was in the works.  Depending on what your plan was for taking profit (hitting a certain profit %?  Holding until pennies or worthless?), I would have thought about exiting or at a minimum taking partial profits if I had not done so already (I would have closed some around ~~5210~~ 5120).

If you didn't exit, you'd be in for the ride back up. I personally wouldn't have held anything but runners at this point, knowing I would have theta working for me.  Since you had a 5175-80 spread, I would at least waited to see if 5180 held before bailing on the runner.

Breakdowns are difficult to trade as they're prone to big bounces before heading back down.  I don't know how many spreads you sold, but that's why it's important to take partial profits along the way and hold a runner to Valhalla if you want to gamble a bit.",others answered technical question contract price stop address price action first congrats sticking stop strategy exiting trade planned one difficult thing especially seeing trade go favor exiting mean strategy wrong impossible tell based one trade sometimes happens accept outcome thesis selling call spread sound given backdrop although argue little late party trade took however still plenty reason get trade although little earlier might benefited personally trade price action give much credence moving average unless looking higher time frame also know take profit plan trade assume going take profit point instead holding expiration got level marked pretty well chart especially ish level prior chart false breakdown level scary bullish bounce retest around creating pivot weak bounce chopped bit failed failure pivot would told get ready go short failure reclaim level sure enough failed would looking enter short position sell call spread backtest stopping trade level reclaimed meaning price move level flip resistance support turning move another false breakdown level price rejected around would also coincides touch one moving average chart also draw trendline top candle candle see another intersection point confluence give higher confidence trade happen entered trade already green candle subsequent bounce would given pause set new low probably gone trade personally entry rejection ok coincided sloping trendline mentioned earlier trade eventually break level head lower get tricky price swept low set reversed key put gamma level basically place lot long put go itm mass closure put cause price move moved back tested turning support would signal bounce work depending plan taking profit hitting certain profit holding penny worthless would thought exiting minimum taking partial profit done already would closed around exit ride back personally held anything runner point knowing would theta working since spread would least waited see held bailing runner breakdown difficult trade prone big bounce heading back know many spread sold important take partial profit along way hold runner valhalla want gamble bit,Comment,['MA'],Banks & Finance

The question is whether the loss on rolling the futures contract exceeds the 4% made on holding treasuries. And you need to see how much premium the back month future trades wrt the expiring future.

options,Market Anxiety Spikes: S&P 500 Options Show Rare Volatility Backwardation,market anxiety spike p option show rare volatility backwardation,Title,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
options,"
The S&P 500 options market is flashing signs of unusual short-term anxiety. Traders have bid up the prices of near-term options so much that the implied volatility for options expiring in the next couple of days is now higher than that of options expiring weeks out. This rare condition, called backwardation in the volatility term structure, suggests the market is bracing for immediate risks to equities, more so than for longer-term uncertainties.

This article breaks down what implied volatility and backwardation mean, why this reversal has appeared, what’s driving current market jitters, and how investors can interpret these signals.

Understanding Implied Volatility and Backwardation
Implied volatility (IV) reflects the market’s expectation of future volatility, derived from option prices. When traders anticipate larger swings in the market, they are willing to pay more for options, pushing IV higher. 

Term structure of volatility refers to how implied volatility changes for options with different expiration dates. Normally, IV increases with time to expiration—known as contango—because there is more uncertainty over a longer horizon. However, when near-term events are perceived as particularly risky, this relationship can invert. That’s called backwardation, and it signals that the market expects more volatility in the immediate future than further out.

Currently, the S&P 500 options market is experiencing this rare backwardation, suggesting that traders see a short-term storm on the horizon.

The Numbers Behind the Anxiety
Data from the options market show a dramatic spike in implied volatility for near-term expirations:
April 3, 2025
Raw implied volatility: 35.0%
Adjusted baseline: 28.5%
Traders are pricing in roughly 98% more volatility than normal.

April 4, 2025
Raw implied volatility: 32.3%
Adjusted baseline: 18.4%
Implied volatility has 86% more volatility than the baseline.

Even after removing the excess volatility related to these two key dates, the adjusted baseline implied volatility across expirations remains elevated—around 19%, compared to a year-to-date average of 16%. This suggests that the overall market tone remains cautious beyond just the immediate headlines.

What's Driving Market Jitters?
Several major factors are converging to elevate short-term volatility:
Geopolitical Tensions: Continued overseas hostilities and uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy have created a cloud of unease. Conflicting commentary on tariffs and foreign policy developments are fueling investor caution.

Macroeconomic Events: A wave of critical economic data and central bank communications is hitting the market this week.

Thursday, April 3
OPEC Meeting: Oil price expectations and inflation concerns hang in the balance.
Initial Jobless Claims: A key gauge of labor market health.
S&P Global Services PMI: Insight into the services sector’s strength.

Friday, April 4
Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Rate: One of the most important data releases of the month.
Fed Chair Powell Speech: Market participants will parse his words closely for clues on interest rate policy.
Additional Fed Speakers: Several other Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak throughout the week, adding to uncertainty.

The concentration of potential market-moving events in such a short span has significantly raised the stakes, and the options market is reflecting that tension.

Bottom Line
The S&P 500 options market is sending a clear message: traders are bracing for potentially large market moves over the next few days. With geopolitical tensions simmering, trade policy uncertainty lingering, and critical economic data and Fed commentary on deck, it's no surprise that implied volatility is spiking—particularly for April 3rd and 4th.

Even after adjusting for these specific risks, the market remains more volatile than usual. For investors, this is a moment to assess your risk exposure, avoid knee-jerk decisions, and stay focused on long-term strategy while being prepared for short-term turbulence.

# Trailing-stop order example:

* You placed a 5% trailing-stop order on a recently purchased stock position.
* As the stock increases in price, if—at any point—the bid retraces (falls) by 5%, a market order will automatically be entered for the quantity you specified.
* For example, you entered this order when the stock price was $100 per share.
* If the bid price increases 9% to $109 (assuming it never pulled back 5% on its way up to $109), and then drops 5% to $103.55, a market order will be sent.
* The effective change, from the time the trailing-stop was placed until the order was triggered, would be 3.55% above where you originally placed the order.
* Since a trailing-stop order becomes a market order when triggered, it behaves very similar to a standard stop order. 

You can compare it with a covered call or collar strategy.

For the example given, you can simultaneously sell a put to reacquire the shares. The put may be assigned after the shares are sold by the stop.",example trailing stop loss order http www schwab com learn story help protect position using stop order http www schwab com learn story help protect position using stop order trailing stop order example placed trailing stop order recently purchased stock position stock increase price point bid retraces fall market order automatically entered quantity specified example entered order stock price per share bid price increase assuming never pulled back way drop market order sent effective change time trailing stop placed order triggered would originally placed order since trailing stop order becomes market order triggered behaves similar standard stop order compare covered call collar strategy example given simultaneously sell put reacquire share put may assigned share sold stop,Comment,['SCHW'],Banks & Finance

5880 short calls

5290 long puts

4460 short puts

But before the close, they closed that position out and rolled to the following for the end of June quarterly expiration:

5905 short calls

5310 long puts

4480 short puts

If you follow people liked Andy Constan on X, he likes to make a bet on which strike we end up closer to, the short calls or the long puts. Exceedingly rare to get down to the short puts. Things have gone very wrong if we're all the way down there by the end of the quarter.

My thought: we appear to have temporarily exhausted sellers, I could see us back above 5800 in April. But, I do think we end June a lot closer to 5310 than we are up near that 5905 strike.

FWIW, this is the first quarter since 2023 where this quarterly collar trade had shifted down in strikes quarter over quarter.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-04-04.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

for e.g. back of the envelope math, i would have adjusted if my p&l was -$225 ish as i collected $162 when i initiated this trade. 

Anyway point is, you dont panic when markets drop over 100 points. you stay mechanical. 

so my simple adjustment would have been to sell a call spread to close out any open delta and neutralize the trade. 

short strike is at 5375 and long strike is 25 points out at 5350

i paid $434 to initiate this trade and collected $162

take out $15 commissions to get in and out of the trade. there's a potential roi of over 22% on this trade.

options,"This is a quick update to my PSA about not trusting the mid calculated by your broker.

I calculated that my put is worth at least 2X and today there are some new quotes which are right where they should be. no more zero bid and a broker provided average, which if you use to roll, you will be taken to the cleaners.

So whenever you trade, just stop and think what your option is worth, and calculate its value in your head by looking at the opposite call/put, and use put call parity and time value to arrive at a fair price.

Just like my MSTR short on Friday which was a 100% overnight gain, here is one more bonus in this post. I bought this put when MS went down after a massive runup, and I thought I was paying a cheap price at the time.

Today after 4 days it doubled in price so I will not go for more, because I think we will rally this week, and I will take the 100% 4 day gains.

The lesson here is to know and internalize the options prices, and to not blindly follow the broker calculated theoretical prices, which might be a simple average using a zero bid.

**Who is Redhawkred5?**

Hi, I’m **Redhawkred5** – an anonymous CPA by trade and an **exited founder** (I built and sold a startup, and lived to tell the tale!). I have a serious passion for **macroeconomics**, **statistics**, and **AI**, and now I’m channeling all that nerdy energy into managing my own portfolio. I’ve been a long-time lurker, but this is my first post under this alias. My style is slightly humorous but hopefully intelligent and approachable. 😊



**Why Share My Portfolio?**

I’m posting my portfolio here as a form of **accountability** (hard to hide from bad decisions when it’s all public!), and to invite **discussion** and **feedback**. Think of this as me thinking out loud – an open-air investing journal. I’m hoping to learn from the community, spark some conversations, and keep myself honest about my strategy. Please feel free to tell me if I’m crazy… or just crazy enough to pull this off!



**Core Investment Thesis**

My core investing thesis is to **generate high returns with manageable risk** by blending steady income strategies with high-upside bets. In practice, that means I aim to **harvest premium from volatility** (earning regular income from option trades) and **reinvest it** into growth opportunities. I believe that by exploiting certain market inefficiencies – and using a data-driven approach – I can outperform the market. In plain English: I want to be the guy who makes money while the market wiggles around, and still catch some rockets on the side. The endgame is strong **risk-adjusted returns** (I’m targeting a Sharpe ratio > 1.5) with an aggressive growth rate (>20% annual if all goes well).

*(“Options Income Engine” is the strategy described below. The others are individual positions or themes.)*



**The “Quantum Engine” & Volatility Income Strategy**

I jokingly call my overall strategy the **“Quantum Engine.”** It’s basically a fancy name for my system of managing the portfolio using macro trends and statistical signals (with maybe a pinch of AI modeling) to decide where to allocate. The core of this engine is treating **volatility as an asset**: I sell options on high-volatility assets to generate income. In more concrete terms, I’m running a **high-volatility options income strategy** – selling **short strangles** on stocks or indexes with rich premiums.



*What does that mean?* A short *strangle* is just selling a call option and a put option, both out-of-the-money, on the same underlying. I collect option premiums upfront. If the underlying stays within a reasonable range, most of the time those options expire worthless and I keep the $$ as profit. The idea is to **harvest the options’ time decay** (Theta) as a steady **yield** on my portfolio – kind of like earning interest or rent from the market’s volatility. I consider that premium my “income.” Essentially, I’m **turning volatility into yield**: when implied volatility (IV) is high, option prices are juicy, so selling them can be quite profitable as time erodes their value.



Of course, this strategy comes with **risk** – big moves can hurt a short strangle. I mitigate this by careful position sizing, adjustments, and by being selective about what and when I sell. The “Quantum Engine” framework helps here: it’s about using data to gauge how far things might swing (taking into account macro events, stats, etc.) and setting up trades with a **probabilistic edge**.



To ground this in a relatable way, here’s an analogy: *Imagine a child who lies* ***10%*** *of the time.* You can trust what they say most of the time (90% truthiness), but you **always account for that 1-in-10 chance** that reality will be very different from what you expect. My volatility strategy (my little “quantum volatility theory,” if you will) treats the market the same way. Most of the time, things stay within normal bounds and I earn my steady premium – but \~10% of the time, **crazy moves happen** (the market “lies” about being calm). I plan for those liar moments by keeping plenty of cushion and adjusting or hedging if needed. In other words, I trust the odds but I’m always mindful that the unlikely can and will occur occasionally. This approach lets me sleep at night while aggressively collecting theta during the day.



**Moonshot Bets: Biotech, Robinhood, and China**

While the options income engine is my bread-and-butter, I’ve also allocated a chunk of the portfolio to a few **moonshot bets** – high-risk, high-reward positions that could boost my returns (or at least keep things interesting!). These are small, speculative allocations that I’m willing to ride out with volatility:

• **Biotech** –  I like some high EV moonshots and have a couple of peripheral sleeves in the portfolio (like this one) to drive some uncorrelated alpha. The first sleeve is a few biotech moonshots with promising potential and asymmetric upside.



• **End of Society Sleeve/Robinhood (HOOD)** – My thesis here is a dark one unfortunately. My belief is that Robinhood is the best in the business at gamifying and exploiting the increasingly hopeless yet dopamine fueled Gen Z and Millennials. As a user, as pissed off as I was at them for the Gamestop Debacle, I have been impressed with them ever since, as their app and promos are really pushing the market forward. Plus you get the added benefit of this being a highly volatile stock that works great in our Quantum Engine. If Robinhood can “grow up” to be the next schwab, that would represent a value almost 5x Robinhood’s current Valuation. 

• **China - YINN** – This is my **bold macro bet**. YINN is a 3× leveraged ETF bullish on China’s market. Talk about volatility – it’s triple-leveraged exposure to an already tumultuous market! 😅 China’s economy has huge long-term potential, but also significant risk. My thesis here is that after a rough period, there could be a strong rebound in Chinese equities that a leveraged instrument like YINN would magnify. It’s definitely a moonshot – I keep the position size limited, and I’m aware it could swing wildly (or go to zero if the thesis fails spectacularly). But if it pays off, it could **pay off big**.



Each of these moonshots is intentionally kept as a **small percentage** of the portfolio (as you saw in the allocation table). They add a dash of alpha (and adrenaline), but won’t sink the ship if they implode. Plus, having some long equity positions like these gives me something to offset the short volatility trades – a bit of diversification in sources of return.



**Goals & Closing Thoughts**

My performance goals are ambitious: I’m shooting for a **Sharpe ratio > 1.5** (meaning I want significantly better risk-adjusted returns than the market) and a **CAGR > 20%** over the long run. In plain terms, I aim to grow this portfolio more than 20% per year on average, without taking on crazy risk relative to that return. Whether I achieve that is TBD, but setting the bar high keeps me motivated and disciplined.



I’ll continue using this as a personal journal to track progress and tweaks to the strategy. I plan to update and reflect openly – the wins, the losses, and the lessons. **Disclaimer:** This is **not financial advice** by any means. I’m doing this to share my journey, not to tell anyone else what to do. Everyone’s risk appetite is different. This is just what I’m doing with my own money and my own weird mix of math and intuition.



Thanks for reading this far! 🙏 I’m excited to hear any thoughts, critiques, or questions from you all. Let’s see where this goes – hopefully, we’ll beat that Sharpe and CAGR target, and have some fun (and a few laughs) along the way. *Onward!*",tl dr anonymous cpa ex founder sharing personal portfolio

What are you talking about. It sounds like you are talking about buying or being assigned 1m worth of stock while you have 500k in your account. This is idiotic, and you are confusing MARGIN with BUYING POWER.

If you Sell options in a Margin Account and you have 500k cash, then you have 500k Buying Power not 1 million. You do have 1 million Margin to buy stock with .

If a stock is $500, and you sell a 450 Put, you do not need 45k in Buying Power , buy only 5k-10k in Buying Power.  If this confuses you then stop and watch Tastylive for 2 months.

options,"There's no point. But maybe there is. Let's do a deep dive. 

What makes index investing successful ? Such a simple philosophy. But not every company in the index is successful some get kicked out of index and some just fail. What makes the index work is  the relative outperformance of a few companies in recent times and in general the growth showing in the top 10, 100 or even 1000 companies. There are companies busting balls to make their quarterly results happen or even over perform. And we are betting on those management teams and paying stupendous executive comps for them to get results. Sure, the execs take half of it but for their half to perform they need markets to go up which is where we gain. 

We need to spend the same level of effort and have same level of execution. Do we? Do we understand the game, do we game the options (pun was not intended), do we diversify or bank on one trick pony? These form part of the answer. Then other answers are - are you disciplined? Or are you a maverick like musk and Tesla?

I think with the right set of parameters, you can beat the index.

But you don't need to beat the index, you need to over perform it. Remember the taxes. You defer taxes on long term holdings but you pay taxes annually on options. So if you barely beat the index, you are still behind. 

I contend even that can be done if you take a long term outlook. If S&P makes 8% and you make 12% ... both long term, I call that a win. Remember as you compete against S&P, 20% of your competition is against Tim Cook, a certain percentage against Jensen Huang, a certain percentage against Marc Zuckerberg, and so on. But they are not just competing against you, they are fighting each other, then the governments and what not, and can't always be successful and that's partly where your long term edge comes in. And most of the big guys are bound to their companies whereas you have no loyalty you can move from company to company, etf to etf, strategy to strategy as long as you understand the landscape. 

I know it is a bit meandering but hopefully I will iron out my spiel next time around or maybe you get it anyways :)",point maybe let deep dive make index investing successful simple philosophy every company index successful get kicked index fail make index work relative outperformance company recent time general growth showing top even company company busting ball make quarterly result happen even perform betting management team paying stupendous executive comp get result sure exec take half half perform need market go gain need spend level effort level execution understand game game option pun intended diversify bank one trick pony form part answer answer disciplined maverick like musk tesla think right set parameter beat index need beat index need perform remember tax defer tax long term holding pay tax annually option barely beat index still behind contend even done take long term outlook p make make long term call win remember compete p competition tim cook certain percentage jensen huang certain percentage marc zuckerberg competing fighting government always successful partly long term edge come big guy bound company whereas loyalty move company company etf etf strategy strategy long understand landscape know bit meandering hopefully iron spiel next time around maybe get anyways,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
options,"Looking at the data, the US stock market, especially tech and small caps, have to fall further. BUT the US stock market has the ability to completely ignore facts, which could mean that it recovers and then comes down later. And Trump is so erratic that I wouldn't rule out that he does a 180 on his current course. But all in all, I am bearish on US stocks. 

The DAX has to cool off first. I expect it to come down slightly in the next months before rising again. However, I have access to the research if the DZ Bank and they changed their projections to 24.000 points in June and 26.000 points end of the year. Before they were at 19.500 June and 21.500 end of the year. After the 'Sondervermögen' in Germany, they changed it. 

Nevertheless, the best chances right now are found in German and European small caps. Look at the charts of the SDAX or für ETFs for the European small caps. They are still far below their 2021 highs, in contracts to the S&P, NASDAQ or DAX which are all far above these 2021 highs. 

I like your allocation (especially the put on Apple, it's a rare sight). But I think I wouldn't allocate much money on bonds right now. Both in the US and Europe (especially Germany) current developments are currently indicating higher for longer interest rates. This could hinder long-dated bonds from gaining in price. But it depends on how and in which bonds you invest. 

I think a good way right now, besides European and German small caps, is a dividend and credit approach. Dividends from good companies will even flow in times of stagflation. BDC's (business development companies) are generating money through credits and are paying high dividends. They are positive for the year. They only suffer if there is a deep recession. Not 100% safe though. I like ARCC and CSWC, but there are also ETFs for BDCs specifically. 

I would definitely not invest in stocks that are dependent on the consumer and make most of their revenue in the US. The US consumer is cracking down like crazy right now.

options,"I do agree about credit card debt. When rich people access free money/debt, they invest and buy luxury goods. When the money goes away, they get repo’d, downgrade their lifestyle, or the risky investments simply crash and burn (see: Kathie wood’s ETFs)
When poor people access free money/debt they spend it on upgrading their basic goods and have lifestyle inflation that is harder to downgrade. That’s where the credit card spend comes in. 


This is an oversimplification of course. 

 But, Trump has a populist/working class streak in him. He wants to cap credit card interest at 10%, and he implemented no tax on tips. He might even tax the 1% or .1% to fund the no tip tax break. So I do wonder if cc delinquency would end up being a big problem.

options,"Quick counter question:

- If you buy a put, what happens to the position if the price of the underlying goes down?
- what happens to the person who sold you that put? 
- if that person tries to hedge this position by buying stock, what happens to the value of the position if the stock declines? 
- how good is the hedge in this case?



It's always easy to blame someone else for your own inability. It doesn't just happen within finance. People have a tendency to look for external reasons when things don’t go their way.

Others enter hedges, or create structured products. Moreover, almost every retail trader is tiny compared to total volume traded. 

With regards to market making and hedging: they make money by offering liquidity and don't want to take risk. All positions are computed in a centralised risk engine that provides aggregate Greeks (per underlying). 

To make markets, you usually quote several hundred thousand options. Therefore, individual positions don't matter and it's not just the usual Greeks most retail traders know (delta, gamma, Vega, theta) but also higher order Greeks that are looked at.

Using bucketed Greeks is very helpful because it shows your exposure per bucket (tenor, spot price, vol,...). For example, Vega bucketing shows how price risk is spread across 
tenors on an ATM volatility grid. Measures for skew and kurtosis also exist (e.g. the Greeks Rega and sega, albeit these are most frequently used in FX, due to the way the vol surface is quoted). 

On top of the buckets you also use ladders (scenarios). There are 
- implicit scenarios: simple custom scenarios where you change parameters of a deal (shift IVOL, spot etc.)
- explicit scenarios, also called predictive scenarios that are regression based and take indices like S&P, Eurostoxx, FTSE and fetch historical data to check for correlation etc.

options,"Looking for feedback from sports bettors.   
  
Robinhood ($HOOD) recently announced prediction markets including on sports (e.g. March Madness etc).  

What's interesting is that these **prediction markets are open to anyone 18+** (b/c they sit with the CFTC and not states). **Whereas you need to be 21+ for sports betting** (which is regulated by states since 2018). AFAIK, DraftKings $DKNG and FanDuel $FLUT operate in the sports betting area and only in half the US(?), whereas Robinhood is using ""event contracts"" allowing them to access the younger pop across all states. \[HT: https://x.com/dmoses34/status/1904602705416380707\]

$HOOD has over 2x the monthly active users:   
\- RH has about 12M MAUs  
\- $DKNG and $FLUT have \~5M

# How valuable is the younger audience

Morgan Stanley published a sports betting survey which found that **younger bettors** (21-34) **bet more frequently and with higher avg bet sizes** than the other age cohorts.

# Could HOOD steal users from DKNG and FLUT?

* **User base**: I imagine there's a decent amount of DKNG/FLUT users that are already HOOD users. The demographics are very similar - 80% male, avg age mid-30s. Degens (my professional assessment).

BUT:

* **Bet type**: 
   * **Parlays** (stacked outcome bets e.g. lakers will win AND LBJ will score over 23 points AND total points will be over 200) made up:
      * 70% of NFL/NBA bets on FanDuel in 2023 \[https://bircheshealth.com/resources/addicted-to-parlays\].
      * 55% of bets on Paris 2024 olympics \[https://igamingbusiness.com/sports-betting/flutter-olympics-betting-paris-2024/\]
   * Robinhood and Kalshi have so far done single prediction events

My thoughts:

* In near term, HOOD likely won't steal current power users from DKNG/FLUT who like the parlays etc.
* BUT for the 30-40% of bets that are more simple single prediction events, Robinhood could be a compelling alternative, esp. if they're already doing other things on RH like options/crypto trading etc.
* ADDITIONALLY, while they might not be STEALING CURRENT users, I can see how RH can definitely slow long-term growth for DKNG and FLUT as 18-21yo younger users start with RH and stick with them.

# Options Scenarios

Catastrophic scenario for DKNG would be to drop down \~60% to its early 2023 price of $15:

If we take a 1 year time horizon (enough time for HOOD to get traction and then show itself at next year's Super Bowl), the market is pricing in a \~7% chance of that happening:

If you're off by 50% and it only goes down 30% though it's not that interesting:

Though being off 50% on timing so giving this 1.5yrs to play out instead not bad:

Thoughts?   
  
I'm a little bearish on macro so I can see MAYBE the 60% happening, but just on the Robinhood competition factor alone, I don't think I'm 30% confident DKNG will drop 60% in a year...  
  
CAVEAT:

Why do energy stocks seem to hold up when other market sectors don't?

Great question — and very timely. The energy sector often behaves differently from the broader market because it’s tied to a different set of forces. Here’s why energy stocks like those in XLE can hold up — or even rise — when the rest of the market struggles:

>  Energy stocks are some of the few that benefit directly from geopolitical crises, making them a safe harbor during global uncertainty.

⸻


🔁 1. Energy is driven by commodities, not just equities
	
•	While tech or retail stocks depend on consumer spending or interest rates, energy stocks are tethered to oil and gas prices.
	
•	Even during stock market volatility, geopolitical risks, supply constraints, or rising global demand can send oil prices up — which boosts energy stocks.

⸻


💰 2. Inflation Hedge
	
•	Energy prices (especially oil) are a major component of inflation.
	
•	When inflation rises, central banks hike rates, which often hurts growth stocks — but energy companies profit more because they sell the thing that’s getting more expensive.
	
•	This makes energy a defensive play during inflationary periods.

⸻


🛢️ 3. Geopolitical Tensions
	
•	Wars, sanctions, or instability in oil-producing countries (like Russia, Iran, etc.) often drive oil prices higher.
	
•	Energy stocks are some of the few that benefit directly from geopolitical crises, making them a safe harbor during global uncertainty.

⸻


📈 4. Strong Cash Flow + Dividends
	
•	Big players like ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) generate massive cash flows and pay reliable dividends.
	
•	When investors get nervous, they rotate into sectors that offer stability and income, and energy fits that bill.

⸻


♻️ 5. Underinvestment in Fossil Fuels
	
•	Ironically, the global push for green energy has constrained investment in oil and gas production.
	
•	This leads to tight supply, which props up oil prices — and by extension, energy stock prices — even if demand isn’t booming.

⸻

🧠 Example:

In 2022, the S&P 500 fell ~19%, but XLE rose nearly 60%, driven by high oil prices from the Ukraine war, inflation, and tight supply.

options,S&P 500 Implied Volatility Backwardation Reflects Near-Term Event Risks,p implied volatility backwardation reflects near term event risk,Title,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
options,"The S&P 500 options market is currently reflecting heightened short-term anxiety, as seen through a rare condition known as backwardation in the implied volatility term structure. In this state, near-term option expirations exhibit higher implied volatility than those further out indicating that traders are bracing for market-moving developments in the immediate future.

This inversion of the usual volatility curve is driven by a combination of political uncertainty and key macroeconomic events on the horizon. Recent geopolitical commentary, particularly surrounding U.S. trade policy, has fueled investor caution, while upcoming data releases are also contributing to the sense of urgency. As a result, traders are paying a premium for near-term protection in the form of options, elevating short-dated implied volatility.

Elevated Volatility for March 31 and April 4
The included chart, titled “S&P 500 Additional Volatility for Upcoming Macro Events,” illustrates the current structure of implied volatility across the next twelve SPX option expirations. The blue line shows actual implied volatility, while the dashed red line reflects a smoothed baseline with macro event-driven volatility removed. The shaded orange regions represent the additional volatility premium being priced in due to event-specific risk.
Two dates stand out in particular: March 31 and April 4, which both show significant bumps in implied volatility above the base level. This indicates that options traders are pricing in unusually large expected moves around these expirations.

April 4 corresponds with the release of key labor market data, including the U.S. unemployment rate and non-farm payrolls—economic indicators known for their potential to drive broad market shifts. Given their impact on Federal Reserve policy expectations and investor sentiment, it’s not surprising to see a substantial volatility premium for this date.

More curious, however, is the elevated implied volatility for Monday, March 31, a date with relatively few scheduled economic releases. The only major item on the calendar is the Chicago PMI report, which historically has limited market impact. The market’s heightened caution here likely reflects broader political risk, particularly the potential for unexpected developments over the weekend, or other unscheduled headlines that could influence Monday’s market open.

Backwardation Signals Near-Term Risk Premium
Under typical conditions, implied volatility tends to rise with expiration length, a structure known as contango. This reflects the notion that uncertainty generally increases over longer time horizons. However, in periods of concentrated short-term risk, that structure can flip.
This current backwardation suggests traders believe near-term events—particularly those in the coming week—carry greater uncertainty than those further out. This dynamic often arises around periods of macroeconomic releases, political transitions, or geopolitical developments.

Market Assigns Selective Risk to Events
While March 31 and April 4 are seeing outsized implied volatility premiums, other scheduled events appear to be having less of an impact on the curve. For example, Tuesday’s ISM Manufacturing PMI and Thursday’s jobless claims reports are not significantly altering the implied volatility skew. This indicates that the market views these events as lower risk, or at least more predictable in their outcomes.In contrast, the employment data on April 4 remains a major focus due to its influence on broader economic narratives and policy direction. The pricing behavior suggests traders are not only expecting a meaningful move on that day but also seeking to hedge against the possibility of a surprise.

Looking Ahead
The elevated implied volatility at the front of the curve reflects a market in defensive posture. Once the key events—particularly the April 4 employment report—have passed, the term structure may normalize if outcomes align with expectations.

Until then, the options market is a clear signal of investor caution. The significant premiums being paid for protection on March 31 and April 4 point to a near-term environment where headline risk dominates and market participants are actively hedging potential volatility shocks.

This behavior underscores the importance of monitoring implied volatility structures—not just for directional cues, but for insights into how the market is pricing risk and timing around major macroeconomic and political developments.

For alerts I use Think Or Swim (TOS) and barchart.com. TOS is the web/desktop platform from Schwab and it is one of the platforms used by more serious casual traders (if that makes sense). It is ugly and clunky but it has a lot of useful data. Plus they are not predatory PPOF like Robinhood. Do yourself a favor and transfer to another broker. 

Both barchart and TOS are free to use, although barchart does have some features paywalled. 

Here's the AI explanation of payment for order flow (PPOF) and why it sucks.
 
Robinhood, like many zero-commission brokers, earns revenue through payment for order flow (PFOF), where market makers pay them to route customer orders to them for execution, rather than to exchanges. 

Here's a more detailed explanation: 

What is PFOF? 

PFOF is a practice where market makers (wholesalers) pay retail brokerages to route their customers' orders to them for execution. 

How it works for Robinhood: 

Robinhood, and other brokers, receive payments from market makers for the opportunity to fulfill their retail customers' orders. 

Why it's controversial: 

PFOF raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as brokers might be incentivized to route orders to the market maker that pays the most, rather than the one that offers the best execution price for the customer. 

Robinhood's reliance on PFOF: 

Robinhood has stated that PFOF is a significant revenue source, though they have also said it is a ""small chunk"" of their revenue. 

SEC Scrutiny: 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has previously reviewed and allowed PFOF to continue, but there have been discussions about potential changes to the practice. 

Alternatives to PFOF: 

Some brokers, like Fidelity and Interactive Brokers, largely avoid PFOF and instead focus on direct routing to exchanges. 

Robinhood's Diversification: 

Robinhood has been diversifying its revenue streams beyond PFOF, including through net interest income, securities lending, margin, and subscriptions. 

Impact on the Industry: 

The rise of zero-commission brokers like Robinhood, which rely on PFOF, has led to a shift in the retail brokerage industry, with many traditional brokers also adopting similar models.",bought mine way otm course kicking could afforded near money put well getting rich overnight could still nice little profit alert use think swim tos barchart com tos web desktop platform schwab one platform used serious casual trader make sense ugly clunky lot useful data plus predatory ppof like robinhood favor transfer another broker barchart tos free use although barchart feature paywalled ai explanation payment order flow ppof suck robinhood like many zero commission broker earns revenue payment order flow pfof market maker pay route customer order execution rather exchange detailed explanation pfof pfof practice market maker wholesaler pay retail brokerage route customer order execution work robinhood robinhood broker receive payment market maker opportunity fulfill retail customer order controversial pfof raise concern potential conflict interest broker might incentivized route order market maker pay rather one offer best execution price customer robinhood reliance pfof robinhood stated pfof significant revenue source though also said small chunk revenue sec scrutiny security exchange commission sec previously reviewed allowed pfof continue discussion potential change practice alternative pfof broker like fidelity interactive broker largely avoid pfof instead focus direct routing exchange robinhood diversification robinhood diversifying revenue stream beyond pfof including net interest income security lending margin subscription impact industry rise zero commission broker like robinhood rely pfof led shift retail brokerage industry many traditional broker also adopting similar model,Comment,['SCHW'],Banks & Finance

options,"fwiw:

03/25/25 6:58 AM

A multi-billion dollar trade adopted by what's been dubbed the JPMorgan option whale could help the stock market rally over the next week, according to a market observer.

Kevin Muir, a former institutional trader who writes the Macro Tourist blog, says it's likely that dealers taking the other side of the trade will need to buy the market into the quarter-end to manage their exposure, underpinning the S&P 500 SPX in the process.

The S&P 500 gained 1.8% on Monday and climbed over 4% from the lowest close of the month.

Muir's observations refer to the JPMorgan Hedged Equity Fund JHEQX, which invests in the S&P 500 and uses options to protect the fund, or hedges it, from market declines. Options give a trader the right to buy (a call) or sell (a put) a financial asset at a particular price (the strike) by a particular time (expiration).

As markets crept ever higher in recent years, many investors wanted to be in stocks but became wary that high valuations could cause a swift sell-off, and so they plumped for the JHEQX.

""The popularity of this strategy has been staggering. Eight years ago, this fund had less than $500 million of assets. Last month, it topped $21 billion,"" says Muir.

And as the fund has grown, so has the options trade applied to it.

Muir calculates that last quarter, for example, the JHEQX sold 40,000 S&P 500 call option contracts, a bet worth a notional $24 billion. Positions of such a size is why Muir calls the fund the JPMorgan option whale.

(Note this has nothing to do with a controversy over a credit-default swap loss at JPMorgan that was dubbed the London whale.)

Option market makers, or dealers, who take the other side of the whale's trade need to constantly adjust their exposure as their risk vacillates with the underlying market's moves.

Consequently, ""the size of this option trade creates a situation where the tail wags the dog,"" says Muir.

To explain what he means, Muir presented in the chart below the dealer action related to their JHEQX exposure late in the final quarter of last year.

During that period the dealers were what's known as ""long gamma,"" meaning that as the S&P 500 rose steadily into the option strike level, they needed to sell the index's futures, or hedge, to offset their increased exposure to the price changes. It also meant that when the S&P 500 fell they would trim their hedge by buying the index's futures.

This process - known as delta hedging - compressed volatility. And as Muir notes, it ""got so pronounced that for 12 trading days [in December] when the gamma was largest, the S&P 500 traded in a narrow band of less than 1%.""

However, when the opposite happens, and the market falls to the strike where the market makers are short gamma, volatility is exaggerated by their hedging activities - that's because they manage their exposure by selling as stocks decline and buying when they rise.

This scenario, says Muir, is what happened at the end of February and early March, often causing great volatility. ""The JPM Option Whale position has played an important role in determining the market's path,"" he says.

And it's likely led to a very stressful time for the option market makers struggling to manage their positions, he adds: ""Can you imagine telling the big boss that you need to sell a billion of spooz [S&P 500 futures] into the close cause the market is down 1.25%, only to buy it back the next day when it rallies 2%? Yet that's exactly what happened on March 13th and 14th.""

So, what does all this mean for the run up into the JHEQX option roll-over at the end of this quarter?

Muir says that as long as the S&P 500 stays firmly above this quarter's option strike of 5,565, then the need for dealers to reduce their short exposure will increase as expiry approaches. Also helping is that dealers have been able to take advantage of last Friday's big option expiry to reset their gamma exposure.

""This has the effect of reducing the negative gamma from JPM Option Whale trade. At these levels, the negative gamma position has probably been neutralized (or at least significantly reduced),"" says Muir.

Muir describes himself as a ""Kodiak grizzly"" on the market longer term, but adds that he sees a rally up to quarter end.

""The size of the JPM Option Whale position means that it will dictate market action in the coming week much more than many market participants realize,"" he says. ""All in all, providing gamma to the marketplace will be positive and will tend to drive the stock market higher. No sense overthinking this. The odds favor a move higher.""

OP chose to close the put wing of the condor early, not ideal, when they should have just let it expire because letting an option expire nets more profit of the premium. 

OP is likely at least a little cooked because the difference between their sold calls on SPX 5700 and their owned calls at 5705 netting a ~4k loss, however the premiums on their puts should have offset this loss at least some.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-03-28.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

options,"Been digging into some options data lately and noticed something that might be flying under the radar.

There’s a tool called Prospero that tracks net options sentiment—a metric that aggregates how bullish or bearish institutional flows are across thousands of stocks and ETFs—and lately, a lot of bearish sentiment has been showing up. Over the past few weeks, institutional risk appetite has basically [fallen off a cliff](https://open.substack.com/pub/prosperoai/p/did-we-discover-that-institutional?r=o291l&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false).

Options sentiment may have actually flagged the shift before the market dipped. Net Options Sentiment has essentially flatlined, dropping to zero, which suggests there’s little to no institutional appetite for upside plays at the moment. When sentiment hits that kind of extreme, it can sometimes be a signal that the market is entering the early stages of a longer Bear move. Not guaranteed, of course, but historically, this kind of setup has shown up before things start to unravel.



https://preview.redd.it/52sn0w9fofqe1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ec01918ee460f2776c574ed0d6fb387250b4b1

So what’s driving this? After a significant drop in equities recently (SPY and QQQ both took a hit), there appears to be aggressive downside hedging by institutions. A big surge in puts is showing up well below current market levels, with almost no demand for calls above. That combo—heavy downside protection and light upside speculation—is a textbook sign of caution, if not outright fear.

Meanwhile, the headlines are mixed. JPM is saying “[the worst is over,](https://www.ainvest.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-sees-severe-stock-market-pullback-2503)” and some are calling for a short-term bounce. But the underlying sentiment data—especially from options markets, which tend to move ahead of the headlines—tells a different story.

For context: Prospero ranks over 2,000 stocks and ETFs on this sentiment scale. SPY is currently sitting in the most bearish percentile, which historically hasn’t been a great sign. That kind of positioning tends to show up when the smart money is bracing for more pain.

Curious if others are seeing similar sentiment shifts—whether from VIX flow, dark pool activity, or even just price action. Is this the bottom, or more pain ahead?

options,"What 3 technical rules are you waiting for to hit? 

If you’re seeing these opportunities as you say, why are you not taking them when you have 2/3?

If you tested both conditions and the 2/3 situation plays out at much lower percentage of the time compared to your 3/3 setup, than ignore the noise and follow your plan. That’s what makes sense to me. 

If you know the odds on 2/3 and you’re seeing these amazing “should’ve could’ve” situations, are you sure it’s not just the low percentage of time it plays out happening? If it’s a 60% edge situation and maybe 2/10 actually run far enough to make the risk to reward great enough to take but the other 4 are just small wins, are you sure you want to be taking these trades? Isn’t that why you’re waiting for 3/3 conditions to be present? 

Will your system be able to handle that kind of thing if you start taking these lower probability setups? 

Sometimes I feel like discretionary can be attractive, simply because it’s easier to just say “I’m discretionary” and go out and gamble…. I’ll admit I’ve applied the title to myself out of laziness in the past. Some hot hand fallacy and dunning Kruger made me boast the title confidently even. 

I can say out of 4.5 years of trading, only recently have I actually tried to develop and run a mechanical system. 

This was with an underfunded (so actually still gambling because it didn’t really cover the risk of ruin calcs I ran) futures account set up to only take 3 different day trade setups I’ve tested. Only market traded was the CME S&P futures using micro contracts as the chosen instrument. 

Entry conditions were pretty limited as it as all 3 price action setups still required the presence of a strong trend to qualify as a signal. I defined “strong trend” by a quantified signal- so as to remove “discretion” actually. 

“Discretion” was the absolute number 1 thing working against my success, even despite underfunding the strategy. 

There were so many times where my trend conditions and price action setups presented themselves, yet I didn’t enter because my discretion said things like “no the mag7 aren’t in sync, the trend might not be strong enough with AAPL going against the rest” or “this has the makings of a reversal day, I better sit this one out” or “I’m not feeling the trade anymore, better move my stop into profit to protect my gains”

Had I been able to operate mechanically like a robot I would’ve had great success.

Of course my own emotional control and the fact that I was underfunded played into these profit costing decisions, but every time I failed to take a setup it was DISCRETION. I talked myself out of winner after winner. Sure some losers too, but upon backtesting It was the difference between multiple hundreds of percentage points… instead of making $200 on $666 in 3 months I could’ve made thousands if my entries and exits were executed as per the initial trading plan and not my discretion. 

Honestly typing it all out like this makes me think I should try to code the strategy and take myself out of the picture.

Edit: 

I’ll add that since it was a day trading system it was kind of insulated from having to use discretion for what market conditions were in. 

And that it’s possible that the last 3 months might have had this kind of thing performing better than it normally would.

Also I blew the account in week 13 by operating grossly outside of the stated parameters and unstated risk management rules.

options,"You need to separate two concepts: conversion and hedging.

1. Conversion

Conversion is about exchanging one currency for another. Most standard FX derivatives are USD-based, so if you're dealing with other currency pairs (like EUR/CZK), they often need to be traded over-the-counter (OTC).

OTC trades typically require a minimum notional of €1 million, making them less accessible for smaller hedges.

2. Hedging

Hedging is about protecting the value of your assets or income from currency fluctuations. If you're earning in EUR and want to protect against depreciation versus CZK, you can use futures. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) offers EUR/CZK futures with a €100,000 notional value.

By selling the future, you hedge against EUR weakening relative to CZK—so if the EUR drops, the value of your hedge increases, offsetting the loss in purchasing power.

This is a straightforward and cost-effective way to manage your FX exposure without dealing with the complexity or size requirements of OTC contracts.

thetagang,"Probably good thing to do differently is don't open trades before major meetings with trump are scheduled. Wait a week, or two, or three until after to see what the market does.

I mean, a quick look at tariffs and you can easily understand inflation is coming. people are already strapped for cash in america (at least most people), and so they'll have to cut some spending as prices rise. as they do that, that money that was previously going to various companies in terms of revenue will be lost. so companies will have less revenue, and probably less profit margins, leading to worse performance overall and the S&P thus should fall in theory.

obviously this is all easy to say in hindsight seeing the drops, but I don't think we're done with the kangaroo up and down moves until earnings season for some of the major companies has been passed again. we will likely either see worse guidance, pushing stocks lower, or no guidance at all and the market may perceive that to be highly negative as well.

thetagang,"The Nasdaq entered bear market territory on Friday's session. The Russell entered a bear market on Thursday. The S&P sits at -17.41% from the closing high on 2/19.

The reason I'm stating this is not because the total percentage off the highs, even though this is important. I've always found it a lot easier to see understand what's happening in the market through the lens of volatility, especially with the S&P 500.

We all know the VIX closed at 45, which is super high, 98.7th percentile. The last time we closed over this level was 3/9/2020, the second down leg of the covid crash. Prior to that, 10/3/2011, 8/8/2011, 5/20/2010. Then prior to that, we had an extended period between Sept of 2008 and Mar of 2009 where we routinely closed over 45. Why is this important? These levels typically aren't seen outside of a significant market event, which historically has been -16% (2010 sell off), -19.67% (2011 taper tantrum) and -34% (covid crash).

For context, the 1 StDev % for a daily move in the S&P, is 1.76%. Friday's move was between 3 and 4 StDev's.

There is a paper on SSRN that uses a 4-stage Markov model to identify regime changes such as bull and bear markets and bull corrections and bear rallies. The Image below is a graph of that model using the latest data. (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=1939486). I'm including a table at the bottom of this post with the table of the data.

https://preview.redd.it/jfp20hqsg1te1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=938d74addd1af3b18e07bbd5d78ffdef17459243

This sub doesn't allow multiple image posts, so I'm linking to a chart with the rolling 1-month (orange), 3-month (purple) and 1-year (blue) sigma for the S&P 500. The green line is the VIX (implied 30D volatility). You can see from the blue line (1YR) that volatility has generally been on the rise since the august correction in 2024. The orange line is the 1-month rolling sigma, which is now at the highest level since 2020 and not typically seen outside of a bear market. [https://imgur.com/a/1c4JJWG](https://imgur.com/a/1c4JJWG)

This is the same chart with the same rolling sigmas, but for the VIX. [https://imgur.com/a/06nuJQR](https://imgur.com/a/06nuJQR)

Finally, its important to look at the VIX term structure and how far over the tips of the skiis we get during big sell offs. The anatomy of a basic sell off will put the cash VIX above the 3M VIX (backwardation). When we start to come out of backwardation is typically a good buying opportunity. Not always, there are no set rules.

This is an image showing the VIX term structure. On friday, we closed at the highest level of backwardation since 2020. [https://imgur.com/a/yaanBPP](https://imgur.com/a/yaanBPP)

Is the market crashing? I would consider the last week to be a crash. That's not a technical term. There is significant macro economic associated with the reasons behind this sell off. Anything can change on a dime in the current state, but there is nothing to suggest that this is over. **BE VERY CAREFUL WITH TAKING ON RISK IN THIS MARKET.** Both up and downside risk are likely underpriced. Bear markets have face-ripping rallies when people rush to cover their shorts. That doesn't mean things are over. For anyone trading through the last bear market, we saw +10% rallies, only to reach lower lows.

There were a couple VERY worrisome things that happened last week. On Thursday, equities sold off (obv), but SO DID the USD. The act of selling a IS stock is literally buying dollars, so usually there is something of an inverse correlation between the two. On a day when stocks sell off, we SHOULD see the dollar rising. The fact that it was falling simultaneously, means that people were selling dollars for other currencies. 

Something I noticed yesterday was that while equities sold off, so did gold, even with rates falling. This suggests liquidation. People are not concerned about returns, but capital preservation.

thetagang,"So, as the title suggests, I would like to ask for a second opinion on this matter and if I am safe.

I am currently using the wheel strategy on various stocks and also on LETFs (I know, maybe not ideal), keeping 50% cash, similar to what some people here do, and I am using Interactive Brokers.

I’ve also invested around €10,000 in the S&P 500 and in 2x leveraged S&P 500 ETFs.

My aim was to keep excess liquidity well above my maintenance margin, ideally, several times higher. For example, if my maintenance margin is 10, I was targeting an excess of 40.

However, following the recent news about the tariff war and the market downturn, I noticed yesterday at market open that my excess liquidity had dropped below the maintenance margin. (I realize I probably need to hold more cash going forward to avoid this situation.)

I quickly closed some positions at a minimal loss and rolled others. This brought my excess liquidity back above the maintenance margin.

Shortly after, while researching hedging strategies, I received a margin call notification. I suspect that Interactive Brokers may have updated their risk parameters, because moments earlier everything appeared to be ok.

Without hesitation, I closed two more positions and bought a put option on NVDL, trying to form a short put spread with my existing sold put position.

Additionally, I opened a bear call spread on NVDL and a risk reversal on TQQQ.

As of now, my maintenance margin is approximately 7,120, and my excess liquidity is around 20,000.

The total collateral required for all my cash-secured puts is $44,907, while I currently have $41,226, including premiums (with about $36,400 in cash). I initially believed this would be sufficient to avoid needing any hedging strategies.

Furthermore, I’m planning to deposit around €1,400 this week and at least another €500 by the end of the month.

So,

thetagang,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 14 the average premium per week is $902 with an annual projection of $46,878.

All things considered, the portfolio is down $59,833 (-19.57%) on the year and up $372 (+0.15%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Today started a $600 per week contribution streak. The next goal is $400k; although it has been a rough start. I will continue to post through the carnage for better or worse. 

The portfolio is comprised of 91 unique tickers up from 96 last week. These 91 tickers have a value of $214k. I also have 150 open option positions, down from 155 last week. The options have a total value of $31k. The total of the shares and options is $245k. 

I’m currently utilizing $25,800 in cash secured put collateral, up from $25,500 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage. The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down $20,827 this week and are up $17,959 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

Last year I sold 1,459 options and 401 YTD in 2025.

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.

thetagang,"Don't go the methylamine route if you can avoid it. One thing that always bothered me was that the MA/PAA synthesis creates a racemic mixture (50/50 mix of the ""left"" and ""right"" handed molecule) where only one enantiomer is bioactive. So you're basically throwing 50% of your product away or making your shit weak.  The same goes for the modified birch reduction method. 

The advantage of the pseudoephedrine reduction is that you get the pure bioactive enantiomer so it's vastly preferred.  The combat meth act of 2005 made this nearly impossible to scale, however.

Additionally, I’d like to take this opportunity to expand on my own playbook of entry and exit strategies for options trades, which ties into your interest in the directional relationship between the underlying stock price and the option price when selling calls and puts. This includes forecasting stock price movements based on market conditions and stock-specific factors to optimize trade timing.



### Concepts for Entering and Exiting Options (Selling Calls and Puts) with Stock Price Forecasting

Forecasting stock price involves analyzing **market conditions** (e.g., volatility, trends, macroeconomic factors) and **stock conditions** (e.g., technicals, fundamentals, catalysts). Here’s how to apply this to selling calls and puts:

#### Selling Calls (Covered Calls or Naked Calls)
Selling a call obligates you to sell the stock at the strike price if exercised.

##### Forecasting Stock Price for Entry:

- **Market Conditions**:
  - **High Volatility**: Elevated VIX (>20) or sector-specific volatility suggests larger premiums but potential for sharp moves—favor if you expect a ceiling.
  - **Bearish Trend**: A downtrending market (e.g., S&P 500 below its 50-day moving average) supports a bearish or neutral call-selling outlook.
  - **Economic Data**: Upcoming rate hikes or weak GDP growth may pressure stocks, capping upside.
- **Stock Conditions**:
  - **Technicals**: RSI >70, stock near resistance, or overextended Bollinger Bands signal a potential reversal or stall.
  - **Fundamentals**: Weak earnings, high P/E ratios, or negative news (e.g., lawsuits) suggest limited upside.
  - **Catalysts**: Post-earnings stagnation or fading momentum after a rally.

##### When to Enter (Sell a Call):

- Forecast: Stock price will stay below the strike by expiration.
- Conditions: High IV (e.g., IV rank >50%), overbought signals, or resistance ahead.
- Covered Call: You own the stock and are fine selling at a higher strike.

##### When to Exit (Buy Back the Call):

- **Forecast Shift**: Stock breaks resistance or market turns bullish (e.g., VIX drops sharply).
- **Profit**: 50-80% of premium captured via time decay.
- **Risk**: Stock nears/exceeds strike, or unexpected upside (e.g., takeover rumors) threatens losses.

#### Selling Puts (Cash-Secured or Naked Puts)
Selling a put obligates you to buy the stock at the strike price if exercised.

##### Forecasting Stock Price for Entry:

- **Market Conditions**:
  - **Low Volatility**: Declining VIX or stable markets reduce downside risk, favoring put sales.
  - **Bullish Trend**: Uptrending market (e.g., S&P 500 above its 200-day moving average) supports a bullish/neutral outlook.
  - **Economic Data**: Strong jobs reports or rate cuts signal growth, lifting stocks.
- **Stock Conditions**:
  - **Technicals**: RSI <30, stock near support, or compressed Bollinger Bands suggest a bounce or stabilization.
  - **Fundamentals**: Strong earnings, low debt, or positive guidance indicate resilience.
  - **Catalysts**: Pre-earnings optimism or post-selloff recovery potential.

##### When to Enter (Sell a Put):

- Forecast: Stock price will stay above the strike by expiration.
- Conditions: High IV, oversold signals, or support nearby.
- Cash-Secured: You’re ready to buy the stock if assigned.

##### When to Exit (Buy Back the Put):

- **Forecast Shift**: Stock breaks support or market turns bearish (e.g., rising VIX).
- **Profit**: 50-80% of premium captured as theta decays.
- **Risk**: Stock drops toward/below strike, or sudden downside (e.g., earnings miss) increases assignment risk.

#### Core Concepts with Forecasting:

- **Time Decay (Theta)**: Target 30-45 day expirations to maximize theta while allowing forecast flexibility.
- **Probability**: Sell options with delta 0.20-0.30 (70-80% OTM probability) based on your price forecast.
- **Volatility Forecast**: High IV entry + IV drop exit = profit. Low IV entry requires stronger directional confidence.
- **Risk Management**: Adjust based on forecast confidence—e.g., wider strikes if uncertain.
- **Tools**: Use moving averages, trendlines, and news to refine forecasts.

---

### Example Application
- **Stock**: XYZ at $100.
- **Market**: VIX at 25 (high volatility), S&P 500 trending down.
- **Stock Conditions**: RSI 75, resistance at $105, weak earnings last quarter.
- **Sell Call**: $105 strike, 40 days out, $3 premium. Forecast: XYZ stays below $105.

thetagang,"I learn a lot from your insightful questions. This also makes a useful supplement to the options entry and exit strategy discussion.

I have learned that delta represents a trade-off between premium received and the probability of assignment, tailored to risk tolerance. So lower deltas align with a bearish view, reducing assignment risk. Pair with weeklies (e.g., 1–7 days) if you expect a quick drop, as they have less time for the stock to move, so a lower delta (e.g., 0.10–0.15) keeps the strike further OTM, leveraging rapid theta decay. For 30–45 days, a higher delta (e.g., 0.2–0.3) captures more premium while still benefiting from theta, if the stock stays above the strike (for CSPs) or below it (for CCs); higher deltas for 30–45 days account for slower theta decay and the increased chance of price recovery. 

A 0.80–1% return on capital (e.g., for CSPs premium ÷ cash secured and CCs premium ÷ stock value) at a delta below 0.3 is reasonable and disciplined for a low-risk income strategy. At 0.2–0.3 delta, you’re targeting 70–80% probability of expiring OTM, and theta decay accelerates as expiration nears, especially in the last 30 days. This holds if IV is moderate to high (e.g., 50th–75th percentile), inflating premiums enough to hit that return without needing a higher delta. You can also test 0.3–0.4 in high-IV scenarios to see if the extra premium justifies the risk. Accordingly, the strategy for selling cash-secured puts and selling covered calls would be:

**Cash-Secured Puts (CSPs) in a Bearish Market:**  
Sell CSPs at 0.15–0.20 delta with 30–45 days to expiration on stocks with solid support levels (e.g., 50-day MA). For weeklies, drop to 0.10–0.15 delta. Focus on IV in the 50th–75th percentile to ensure your 0.80–1% return without overreaching on delta.

**NOTE**: 0.3–0.4 range balances premium and probability. A 0.3 delta means a \~30% chance of being in-the-money (ITM) at expiration, leaving a 70% chance of keeping the full premium without assignment. It’s a sweet spot for income without excessive risk of owning the stock. Below 0.2, premiums shrink, reducing your return unless volatility spikes. Note that a bearish view assumes the stock won’t drop below the strike, as assignment could force you to buy at a loss in a sharp decline.

**Covered Calls (CCs) in a Bearish Market:**  
Sell CCs at 0.20–0.25 delta with 30–45 days to expiration, targeting resistance levels (e.g., a prior high). For weeklies, use 0.15–0.20 delta. Adjust up to 0.3 if IV spikes and you’re okay selling the stock.

**NOTE**: 0.3–0.4 range offers a good premium while keeping a 60–70% chance the stock stays below the strike, letting you retain shares. At 0.2 delta, you sacrifice income for near-certainty of keeping the stock, which might not hit your 0.80–1% goal unless IV is high. A caveat, low IV (<50th percentile) might require higher deltas (e.g., 0.3–0.4) to hit your return goal, as premiums shrink.",learn lot insightful question also make useful supplement option entry exit strategy discussion learned delta represents trade premium received probability assignment tailored risk tolerance lower delta align bearish view reducing assignment risk pair weekly e g day expect quick drop le time stock move lower delta e g keep strike otm leveraging rapid theta decay day higher delta e g capture premium still benefiting theta stock stay strike csps cc higher delta day account slower theta decay increased chance price recovery return capital e g csps premium cash secured cc premium stock value delta reasonable disciplined low risk income strategy delta targeting probability expiring otm theta decay accelerates expiration nears especially last day hold iv moderate high e g th th percentile inflating premium enough hit return without needing higher delta also test high iv scenario see extra premium justifies risk accordingly strategy selling cash secured put selling covered call would cash secured put csps bearish market sell csps delta day expiration stock solid support level e g day weekly drop delta focus iv th th percentile ensure return without overreaching delta note range balance premium probability delta mean chance money itm expiration leaving chance keeping full premium without assignment sweet spot income without excessive risk owning stock premium shrink reducing return unless volatility spike note bearish view assumes stock drop strike assignment could force buy loss sharp decline covered call cc bearish market sell cc delta day expiration targeting resistance level e g prior high weekly use delta adjust iv spike okay selling stock note range offer good premium keeping chance stock stay strike letting retain share delta sacrifice income near certainty keeping stock might hit goal unless iv high caveat low iv th percentile might require higher delta e g hit return goal premium shrink,Comment,['MA'],Banks & Finance

The minimum maintenance margin requirement is prescribed by the exchange. Your broker may require more.

It is calculated by using two formulas and using the higher value.

Schwab uses the following formulas for naked puts.

MR=100% of option value + 20% of underlying value - OTM amount, or

MR =100% of option value + 10% of option exercise price.

Leveraged ETFs have higher MR.

So you calculate the MRs with your broker’s formulas for your doomsday scenario. 

In a doomsday scenario, your MR increases while your collateral decreases in value.

I sell OTM naked puts and my analysis shows that I can use up to 60% of my BP to initiate trades.

thetagang,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 13 the average premium per week is $947 with an annual projection of $49,228.

All things considered, the portfolio is down $19,986 (-6.55%) on the year and up $33,154 (+13.25%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I broke my streak of contributions five weeks ago. I will pick it up again next week with a contribution of $600 on Friday. I re-started “the road to”. The next goal is $400k. The numbers don’t look good so far, but I don’t stress on the short term.

The portfolio is comprised of 96 unique tickers up from 95 last week. These 96 tickers have a value of $259k. I also have 155 open option positions, unchanged from 155 last week. The options have a total value of $26k. The total of the shares and options is $285k. 

I’m currently utilizing $25,500 in cash secured put collateral, down from $25,600 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down $10,207 this week and are up $38,786 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

thetagang,"You are pissing up stream... are you getting wet?

You are Selling 3 CSP, , you say Spy, so say a Strike of 500. A CSP would hold

500 \* 100 = 50,000 .... I am a little doubtful that you have 3 of these , but lets go on with the fantasy. 3 \* 50,000 = $150,000  .... petty cash from the cookie jar? So your account needs at least 150k , to support 3 500 sold puts in a Cash Account. 

Now just imagine you have a margin Account at say Schwab with the 150k. Here is what you could do , Sell the 3 Puts (not CSP) that would use 5k per Put as buying power . If you really want to get wild , you could buy 150k of Sgov getting  4.5% paid monthly. The down side Schwab only gives 70% face as BP so that is

150,000 \* .7 = $105,000    Note Tasty would give you 75% face.

Before you tell us about Margin and interest , let me say Buying Power is NOT MARGIN, AND THERE IS NEVER INTEREST CHARGED ON SELLING OPTIONS. Cannot believe this... Call the Trade Desk (on Monday they take the weekend off). Here is another kicker, no waiting at Schwab, IB, Tasty for BP (unlike Fidelity). If you sell some Sgov for cash, it is available the next second for trading.

Will Schwab give you Option Selling , with 150k should be ok, 15k not so much. Tasty seems to give Selling to all accounts.

I know this is not the Reddit Cash Account Story, but it is the way real traders trade.

Not so sure about Buying Power , here are some Tasty vids on the topic.

thetagang,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 12 the average premium per week is $935 with an annual projection of $48,633.

All things considered, the portfolio is down $4,418 (-1.45%) on the year and up $51,851 (+20.84%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I broke my streak of contributions four weeks ago. I will pick it up again next week. I paused the streak to evaluate a few things. The taxes were taken care of and I did not have to draw down on the portfolio. I said I would restart the road to $400k last Monday, but did not follow through. I will start on Monday.

The portfolio is comprised of 95 unique tickers down from 96 last week. These 95 tickers have a value of $274k. I also have 155 open option positions, down from 161 last week. The options have a total value of $27k. The total of the shares and options is $301k. 

I’m currently utilizing $25,600 in cash secured put collateral, down from $31,600 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage. The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up $1,358 this week and are up $48,993 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

thetagang,"So, this isn’t what you asked but I always like to add color for the benefit (or detriment lol) of the community 

Why sell covered calls? 

I much prefer to sell ITM puts in a margin account. 

For example, stock is at $100, I sell a bunch of puts at $110 strike for six months or a year out. 

I collect let’s say $17 in cash at the moment it executes. 

Then invest that $17 into a money market or other stable interest or dividend paying product (I use SGOV). I collect interest there. Or if you’re really aggressive use it to pay off your car or house (only if you have other stocks you can sell if you absolutely had to). 

The $17 is $10 intrinsic value and $7 extrinsic value. In other words, I make $7 regardless of what happens if I hold until close to expiration. 

If the stock rises I make the other $10. 

If it goes down, I simply wait until the extrinsic has evaporated off near expiration (but not to zero or else you get assigned unless using cash settled) and just roll the dates out another 6-12 months at the same strike. If the stock is still at $100, I collect another $17. 

If the stock drops to $90, I collect something more like $27. 

You just keep doing this until eventually it closes above your strike. You literally don’t worry about ups and downs or paper losses or deltas or any of that stuff. You don’t have to trade. You just have to wait. 

If you get lucky and the stock rockets you can always close early and take profits and pick another entry. 

The key of course is to pick a good entry and pick a stock or index that you are SURE (as anyone can be) that *eventually at some point in the future* it will rise to the strike. 
S&P after a 20% correction is a great play, but right now I particularly like VNQ because you have rent escalators every year and real estate isn’t fully recovered from COVID era and high rates, yet…eventually the value WILL go up. 
For this reason I hate anything that can fall out of favor (eg Nike, Tesla) anything priced to grow indefinitely (NVDA), anything that can really permanently sour on you)… just pick things that over time take a fairly straight path upwards even if it isn’t an exciting trajectory and is totally unsexy. I prefer boring etfs or indexes for this reason. 

You have to be disciplined and understand margin and play within your means. It’s not great if you have few assets. You have to be able to absorb any paper losses without getting a margin call. So you can’t go crazy with this and initiate a position that depletes your entire margin off the bat. Unless you have other risk management stuff going on of course. 
But, it can generate a ton of excess profit with very little actual risk over time if you ride out the ups and downs and don’t chicken out and close at the worst time. Again, it’s all about doing it responsibly and within your means.",asked always like add color benefit detriment lol community sell covered call much prefer sell itm put margin account example stock sell bunch put strike six month year collect let say cash moment executes invest money market stable interest dividend paying product use sgov collect interest really aggressive use pay car house stock sell absolutely intrinsic value extrinsic value word make regardless happens hold close expiration stock rise make go simply wait extrinsic evaporated near expiration zero else get assigned unless using cash settled roll date another month strike stock still collect another stock drop collect something like keep eventually close strike literally worry ups down paper loss delta stuff trade wait get lucky stock rocket always close early take profit pick another entry key course pick good entry pick stock index sure anyone eventually point future rise strike p correction great play right particularly like vnq rent escalator every year real estate fully recovered covid era high rate yet eventually value go reason hate anything fall favor eg nike tesla anything priced grow indefinitely nvda anything really permanently sour pick thing time take fairly straight path upwards even exciting trajectory totally unsexy prefer boring etf index reason disciplined understand margin play within mean great asset able absorb paper loss without getting margin call go crazy initiate position depletes entire margin bat unless risk management stuff going course generate ton excess profit little actual risk time ride ups down chicken close worst time responsibly within mean,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

That's its 5-year chart.  Here's its [year-to-date](https://imgur.com/a/gld-5y-IPpVEKY), nearly 3 months.  The dip into the end of February was only 3.3%.  
Compare that to anything else you like to trade.  
([Maybe SPY?](https://imgur.com/a/McbN5wu) That dip is 10.0%.)  

Anyway, I'm not trying to convince you *what* to trade, but gold/GLD has been great for me lately.  (Mainly doing PMCCs and shorter-term Diagonals the TT way.)  

But then I wondered: what if you Wheeled something like that, selling Puts **right ATM**.  If assigned, sell Calls at the strike you got assigned at (or CB from that 1 CSP trade, not all the others before).  

So I started with $100k with margin in ToS Paper Money the morning of Thursday, 3/6. 

And it's un-Godly how much margin they give for GLD.  I don't know if this is typical, but I'm selling 5x more CSPs than I could on a strictly cash basis.  

The verdict?  
2 weeks in, 10 full trading days:  11.3%  
**5.6% per week**  
A truly ridiculous number if you annualize it.  

And yes, PM might not give THE most accurate fills, but I've been playing both sides of the money, where there's tons of liquidity and the spreads are tight.  And I've put in orders at whatever Midpoint they've offered.  
Favorable fills?  Maybe.  But enough to account for numbers *that* good?  

I was put to once, sold Calls at the same strike, was out the next day, and have been on the Put side ever since.  

What helps make these kinds of numbers possible is GLD's **Mon/Wed/Fri expirations.**  
I've always liked selling weekly Puts or Calls, so this is like heroin to me.  

How do you judge how juicy a ticker's options are?  By calculating the ROI of the ATM Puts or Calls, right?  With 2DTE remaining this week:  
NVDA is worth 1.5% ATM  
WMT 0.8%  
GLD just 0.45%  

But that 5x margin multiplier lets GLD become 2.25% ATM just 2 days out.  Annualize that to something stupid like 280%.  

But hmmm, my observed 11.3% in 2 weeks annualizes to 282-293% apy (depending whether you multiply by 52 weeks or 50 to account for the 10 holidays).  

So I'd say the strategy is capturing all the ""juice"" in the ATM options.  

It's been mainly a thought experiment, and I'll keep at it, but what's the downside?  
That gold drops, of course.  
But does gold 'drop'?  
Not really.  It 'drifts', to be sure, but you won't be ""bag-holding"" gold, especially in these unsettled times.  

So there ya go, just wanted to share that with people who might find it interesting.

thetagang,"Hi, thanks for your input.  I think why this looks lucrative to me and not to you is that we have much different investing time horizons.  Of course we want to get to the same place, but I've never been a fan of B&H and trusting the market to come back and all that.  
So to me, 3-4 years is an eternity.  

I like gold because it's steady in what it does; as you mentioned, there's no rug pulls. 185 down to 100 in 4 years?  That's about 46%, agree?  
TSLA has dropped 45% in the *2 months* since Inauguration Day.  
I don't play TSLA or things like it.  

I'm a trend-follower.  I believe we all have the innate ability to look at charts and say, ""That one's going up, and that one's not.""  So I buy the ones that are going up (or trade them with options, generally, as here), and get out when they stop going up.  

But to more directly answer your question:  there's actually a lot of premium in GLD options, even though their IVs are only in the mid-teens.  And the fact that they have M/W/F expirations means I can be a total degenerate and sell 2DTE or 4 or 5.  

For example:  the 2-*trading*-day ATM Call (24Mar281C) is going for 1.15.  That's a whole strike.  
Say gold keeps dropping:  sell the next strike down for a dollar or so.  
And I know that some of the premium will drain out of the Calls if the ETF is dropping, but I still think you'd eventually catch up to your CB.  

Oh, and another option:  sell the darn shares.  How much has GLD ever moved in a day or week?  You're probably only down 5% max, so sell them and move on.  

Thoughts?

thetagang,"I love your counter-arguments, thanks.  
And that was a creative use of AI!  I need to start using it more than I do.  

Okay, you caught me out on glossing over gold's historical price action.  (And I purposely didn't go back farther because it looks even worse.)  
Okay, so Sep 2012 to Sep 2013 is a year, right?  
25% is a ""brutal drop"" in a day.  Or in a week, or in a month.  
*But in a year?*  Not to me, with my investing horizon of months.  

TSLA has dropped 45% since Inauguration Day; now THAT is a brutal drop.  
And it's why I don't play tickers like that, but gravitate to boring ones like GLD.  Which I stop trading when they stop going up.  

But say we stayed in this ""Wheel ATM"" thing with GLD.  
Even *without* leverage, my paper trades so far (granted, only 2 weeks) have averaged 1.1% per week.  
25 weeks of doing that covers the ""drop,"" and the rest is gravy.  
Put the leverage back in, 5.6% per week, and in 5 weeks it's covered.  

Which is why I said somewhere in this thread that I bet you could just follow GLD as it *drifted* down that 25% over a year and hardly even notice it.   

And I'll address your AI points, because I think they mostly help to make the case for gold right now.  (I'm not a gold bug, I promise.  And have almost never touched the stuff before now.  But maybe I'm looking for confirmation bias for this trading vehicle at this point in time.)  

1. Powell said yesterday that inflation's probably going up.  Gold goes up.  
2. China is doing well, look at FXI on the 1y.  I've been twice, in 2016 & 2019.  
3.  I vaguely heard something in the news today about the dollar weakening.  I don't think about currencies though.  
4.   Perhaps still true.  People investing in Bitcoin?  
5. Central Banks are still buying gold, from what little I've read.  Investor sentiment?  That's what I'm here for!  But seriously, the reason I even found GLD was because I was looking at ETFs that are going up as the S&P has started to decline.  Other people may be making those same calculations.  

Take care,

thetagang,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 11 the average premium per week is $914 with an annual projection of $47,405.

All things considered, the portfolio is down $1,132 (-0.38%) on the year and up $49,859 (+20.49%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I broke my streak of contributions three weeks ago. I will pick it up again in about two weeks. I am pausing the streak to evaluate a few things. Taxes are coming up and I am looking into a vehicle. I decided to hold off on the new vehicle and will not need to borrow from the portfolio. 
I will restart the road to $400k on Monday.

The portfolio is comprised of 96 unique tickers unchanged from last week. These 96 tickers have a value of $261k. I also have 161 open option positions, down from 163 last week. The options have a total value of $32k. The total of the shares and options is $293k. 

I’m currently utilizing $31,600 in cash secured put collateral, up from $30,300 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down $1,635 this week and are up $47,635 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

 The people that argue the point are always the most confidently incorrect. So I feel I’ll regret this 😅

A specific option is zero sum but that is a nonsensically narrow view of the problem. Most net option buyers are insuring against an outcome so the insurance allowed them to optimize their actions (e.g. McDonald’s opened many stores more once that they could secure a price of wheat) so even if they lose in the specific contract they are happy with their outcome. 

Anyone that makes money with options looks at their overall portfolio composition and not their specific components. Because the options change your behavior it’s just silly to look at the specific contract as a standalone.

Finally, it really baffles me the hubris that people must have to believe that options are zero sum AND that they can at the same time outperform the market.

In short, I asked Fidelity, and the rep was adamant this is not possible industry wide, no matter how you slice it.

I asked ChatGPT, and it gave this spiel on how it WAS possible with the below output.

I'm curious if anyone is actually employing this somehow?

ChatGPT response:

> Yes, you can sell SPX or XSP options against an SPY position, but it wouldn't be considered a traditional covered call. Instead, it would be a ""delta-hedged overwrite"" or a ""proxy hedge"", and it comes with some nuances:

> ---- Why It’s Not a True Covered Call

> SPX and XSP options are cash-settled and European-style, meaning they cannot be assigned early, whereas SPY options are physically settled and American-style (can be assigned anytime before expiration). Because SPX/XSP options don’t represent actual shares, selling them against SPY isn't a textbook covered call—you're introducing basis risk (the risk that SPX/XSP and SPY prices don’t move perfectly together).

> ---- How It Can Work

> SPY and SPX track the S&P 500 closely, but they aren't identical (SPX is the pure index, SPY is an ETF with dividends, slight expense ratios, etc.). If you sell SPX or XSP calls, you need to adjust the contract size to match your SPY position's delta exposure (e.g., one SPX contract = ~10 SPY contracts, and one XSP contract = ~1 SPY contract). Because SPX options have 60/40 tax treatment (60% long-term, 40% short-term regardless of holding period), it can be more tax-efficient than selling SPY covered calls, which are taxed at short-term capital gains rates if held for under a year.

> ---- Risks to Consider

> Mismatch in settlement: Since SPX and XSP are cash-settled, you won’t have to deliver shares if assigned, but this means you can't just let them exercise into a short SPY position.

> Dividend exposure: SPY pays dividends, while SPX doesn't. If a dividend is coming up, an SPY covered call seller might get early assignment, but that won't happen with SPX/XSP options.

> Tracking error: In extreme market conditions, SPY and SPX/XSP might not move exactly in sync.

> ---- Alternative Approach

> If you're trying to optimize for tax efficiency, another method would be to use synthetic covered calls with SPX/XSP: Hold SPY shares. Instead of selling SPY calls, sell SPX/XSP calls and buy SPX/XSP puts (to create a risk profile similar to covered calls but with cash settlement and tax benefits).

> ---- Bottom Line

> Yes, you can sell SPX or XSP calls against an SPY position, but it’s not a true covered call. You’re taking on some basis risk and settlement differences, but the tax benefits might make it worthwhile. If you're comfortable with those risks, it can be an effective strategy.",saw offhand comment possible idea true idea holding core index position sell cash settled option order take advantage section tax treatment short asked fidelity rep adamant possible industry wide matter slice asked chatgpt gave spiel possible output curious anyone actually employing somehow chatgpt response yes sell spx xsp option spy position considered traditional covered call instead would delta hedged overwrite proxy hedge come nuance true covered call spx xsp option cash settled european style meaning cannot assigned early whereas spy option physically settled american style assigned anytime expiration spx xsp option represent actual share selling spy textbook covered call introducing basis risk risk spx xsp spy price move perfectly together work spy spx track p closely identical spx pure index spy etf dividend slight expense ratio etc sell spx xsp call need adjust contract size match spy position delta exposure e g one spx contract spy contract one xsp contract spy contract spx option tax treatment long term short term regardless holding period tax efficient selling spy covered call taxed short term capital gain rate held year risk consider mismatch settlement since spx xsp cash settled deliver share assigned mean let exercise short spy position dividend exposure spy pay dividend spx dividend coming spy covered call seller might get early assignment happen spx xsp option tracking error extreme market condition spy spx xsp might move exactly sync alternative approach trying optimize tax efficiency another method would use synthetic covered call spx xsp hold spy share instead selling spy call sell spx xsp call buy spx xsp put create risk profile similar covered call cash settlement tax benefit bottom line yes sell spx xsp call spy position true covered call taking basis risk settlement difference tax benefit might make worthwhile comfortable risk effective strategy,Body,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

Closing in on a second 3K week

Have started to reliably make 2K per week. Will be moving offshore if this keeps up. 

Come on, we know the direction already and that's like the biggest advantage ever. I have trades for all five market outcomes: down a little, down a lot, goes nowhere, up a little, up a lot. Right now down a lot and down a little are working overtime. 

I'm laying landmine along the road for the retreating SPX (selling call spreads at 40+ DTE) When they go off, I get paid from the BTC blast. For the first couple of days I set the profit target much smaller. $600 in one day....why wait weeks for another 400 or more. Next trade please. If it's same day I'll take $400 but would prefer $600. These are all 40+ DTE options so if they go against me for a day or two they'll recover soon enough, the overall trend is in my favor at this time.

However, some of the biggest up days happen during downtrends so I wouldn't be surprised to see one sooner or later. Give the faith-based investors a little hope before the next leg down. A return to the 200 day then a rejection or maybe even a look above and fail to fool the rest of us too. 

Expecting a bounce at 5500...so may switch to a week of bullish, not sure, and don't really care, I'm price agnostic. Whatever trend presents itself gets traded if it passes the checklist. If it blows through 5500 I'll trade that too.

thetagang,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 10 the average premium per week is $1,260 with an annual projection of $65,530.

All things considered, the portfolio is down $10,311 (-3.38%) on the year and up $49,847 (+20.36%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I broke my streak of contributions two weeks ago. I will pick it up again in about three weeks. I am pausing the streak to evaluate a few things. Taxes are coming up and I am looking into a vehicle. I might borrow about $10k-$15k from the portfolio and restart the streak when those things are taken care of. This is also the reason I did not start the road to $400k, yet. 

The portfolio is comprised of 96 unique tickers up from 95 last week. These 96 tickers have a value of $271k. I also have 163 open option positions, up from 165 last week. The options have a total value of $25k. The total of the shares and options is $296k. 

I’m currently utilizing $30,300 in cash secured put collateral, down from $30,500 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage. The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down $13,721 this week and are up $49,270 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

Last year I sold 1,459 options and 310 YTD in 2025.

2023 $22,909 in premium |

Annual results:

2023 up $65,403 (+41.31%)
2024 up $64,610 (+29.71%)

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  

The premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years. 

Hope you all are hanging in there. Make sure to post your wins. I look forward to reading about them!

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-04-17.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",highest premium option offer highest ratio implied volatility iv relative historical volatility hv option priced move significantly moved past sell iron condor may priced stock c p change direction put call put premium call premium e r beta efficiency biib hyg n inda n dash xlv n lng adp dfs spy n xlf n expensive call call option offer highest ratio bullish premium paid iv relative historical volatility hv option priced expecting underlying move significantly moved past sell call stock c p change direction put call put premium call premium e r beta efficiency dash biib xlv n inda n spy n lng foxa ibb n dia n expensive put put option offer highest ratio bearish premium paid iv relative historical volatility hv option priced expecting underlying move significantly moved past sell put stock c p change direction put call put premium call premium e r beta efficiency hyg n biib adp inda n dfs xlb n xlf n trow xlp n lng historical move v implied move determine historical volatility standard deviation daily log return underlying asset compare current implied volatility iv option price use dte look back period used determine call put premium associated pricing option implied volatility directional bias range negative bearish positive bullish account rsi price trend moving average put call skew past week priced move given current option price much dollar amount underlying move make call put break even much vol option pricing expected move expiration call put premium much extra paying implied move relative historic move low number mean option cheaper high number mean option expensive efficiency factor represents bid ask spread depth order book relative price option represents much trader pay slippage round trip trade lower number le efficient higher number e r day unitl next earnings release feature still beta work complete list earnings date stock list weekly underlying cheap option market illiquid open interest qualify strategy underlyings used report top result end passing criterion filter,Body,['MA'],Banks & Finance

thetagang,Yes. Markets gonna move but NVDA should stay above $92-$100 and most likely in the $110-$115 range. No real reason for it to rally so taking shorter DTE is better than longer. Nothing is for sure but if I lose shares above my CB I’m not worried because I’ll just reenter with a Buy/Write. Large funds gonna start cutting losers and buying more NVDA. Anything under $115 is a buy based on a Forward P/E of 25x which is insane considering their growth. Until it breaches $115 that’s my CC target and based on where it’s at on Monday will decide if I go 1 or 2 weeks out.

thetagang,"Quick summary -

1) Trade the wheel on stocks you are good holding for weeks or month if needed.

2) If assigned and the CCs cannot be sold at or above the net stock cost, then hold until the stock moves back up. 

Did you know that the S&P 500 hit an all time high just two weeks ago on Feb. 18th? The market is moving up and down which is normal and so calling it a down trending market in such a short timeframe seems premature.

The 1-year S&P is still up 12.5% even after dropping 3.8% over the last month. Keep in mind it is irrational fear that causes unnecessary market drops.

thetagang,"Well, I can discuss generalities but alot more goes into the wheel than just selling a put and then selling a call. Alot of factors matter (the company you are trading, the strikes you are selling, the expiry, what your long-term or short-term plan is, etc). The. first thing you should be doing is trading a company that is a good company you would hold longterm regardless. That is the basics. Never hunt just for high premiums. There are plenty of shitty companies that offer high IV/high premium but are typically the most risky companies. You want to find a balance between risk and reward, and that will only come with experience (good and bad). Generally, if you start with a put and get assigned, you should continue to sell at or above you initial cost-basis. One fatal mistake new sellers make is they panic, or overlook the market to grab higher premiums below CB. And then they get startled when an unexpected move happens, and then they come to Reddit asking what to do, and the options are always shitty (like rolling into eternity). You want to stay disciplined and the money invested should be capital you can afford to wait out downtrends while still taking premium 4-6 weeks out. Your premium may be smaller, but the whole point is if you trade the wheel strategy, you should have capital to wait out downtrends.

I chose it because there's little correlation with S&P. GLD is an alternate asset class. I also chose IBIT for crypto. Bailed on that because of the threat of Bitcoin manipulation from the White House this week.

thetagang,"Hi, are you counting ""recently"" as like the last year from today, up 36%?  
Or maybe since the low in October 2022, from where it's up about 76%?  (Dividing that by 2.33 years gives about 32% per year.)  

I'm thinking if it turns, then maybe it's that kind of slow decline on the 5y chart I posted, starting August 2020, from where it was generally down till Oct '22.  That would be manageable I think, unlike the drop in, say, my recent favorite Walmart after its last earnings.  

And did you mean to say it would blow through my *Calls*?  Because that would be max profit for the trade (assuming I didn't sell them below CB), and would put me back on the Put side where I'd rather be.  

More thoughts?  
Btw, what I'm looking for really is just a stable stock or ETF that doesn't have drastic drops that could leave you bag-holding if you sold Puts.

thetagang,"*Right?*  It's the ""never get assigned"" part that makes it tricky!  

But my thought with gold is:  
1) Keep the timeframe short, like days.  
2) When assigned (on a Put, of course), sell a Call at either:  
 - the assigned Strike, or  
 - Cost Basis (which of course will be lower)  

For instance, GLD closed today (3/6/25) at 268.25.  
The **2**DTE ATM 268P is selling for 1.36 at Midpoint AH.  

That makes its CB 266.64.  
So if/when assigned, sell the 267 Call for ??.  
If it drops, maybe you got 0.64 for the 267C, so you sell the 266C.  
Like that.  

I know that's the same for any stock you wheel, but gold is generally going up over time, and will arguably continue to as long as all this chaos is going on.",right never get assigned part make tricky thought gold keep timeframe short like day assigned put course sell call either assigned strike cost basis course lower instance gld closed today dte atm p selling midpoint ah make cb assigned sell call drop maybe got c sell c like know stock wheel gold generally going time arguably continue long chaos going,Comment,['CB'],Banks & Finance

thetagang,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 9 the average premium per week is $1,284 with an annual projection of $66,780.

All things considered, the portfolio is up +$15,382 (+5.06%) on the year and up $74,251 (+30.26%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I broke my streak of contributions last week. I will pick it up again in about a month. I am pausing the streak to evaluate a few things. Taxes are coming up and I am looking into a vehicle. I might borrow about $10k-$15k from the portfolio and restart the streak when those things are taken care of. This is also the reason I did not start the road to $400k, yet. 

The portfolio is comprised of 95 unique tickers up from 94 last week. These 95 tickers have a value of $300k. I also have 165 open option positions, up from 159 last week. The options have a total value of $20k. The total of the shares and options is $320k. 

I’m currently utilizing $30,500 in cash secured put collateral, unchanged from last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage. The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down $13,316 this week and are up $62,991 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.

thetagang,"Hey ElsOkIguess. Thank you for the comments and questions. Congrats on building your way up to 100 shares of NVDA. This in itself is a great accomplishment. 

>How would you suggest a beginner go about selling covered calls on Nvidia right now? 

Very cautiously. It sounds like you understand the basics, enough to sell a covered call and buy it back. What else is there to know? A lot. It is not just about the performance of the individual stock. The macro environment, tariffs, global conflicts, market uncertainty, earnings seasons, inflation, and many more factors go into the daily ebb and flow of the tickers you own. 

I typically sell 1 DTE plays on Thursday's expecting to close worthless on the following day. However, with the market dipping and spiking recently. More dipping than spiking, it has led to a bit of an adjustment to that weekly Thursday play. Today for example was a bit up in the later half of the day. Not sure what the rest of the week was going to do, I decided to sell 1 DTEs on the tickers that were up +5% on the day. 

I currently have an outstanding CC on NVDA that I sold last week ($131 strike, $103 premium). It expires this Friday. Since NVDA continued to decline this week, the amount to buy back is $7. If I was a risk taker, I might lower the strike tomorrow and take a bit more premium, but I will probably just let it expire worthless on Friday for 100% profit. 

>How are you feeling about the stock in general, given the disconnect between earnings and performance? 

The stock has \~40 EPS multiple which is above the S&P 500s current EPS multiple of \~29. Is it overpriced? I think it is hard to price a company that accounts for about 22% of the entire S&P returns. DeepSeek may have scared off some investors, but I still think NVDA has decades in the tank of significant profits.  

>I’ve sold and bought back one CC right for a clean $380 profit, and although I’ve done what I feel is a lot of research I still don’t really know what I’m doing.

You may want to look into Delta as a starting point to get a better gauge on what you are comfortable selling your covered calls for. I typically sell same week covered calls with a Delta around .1-.2. There are many that believe that 45 days is the sweet spot, but remember to account for earnings reports that may drive up the price in anticipation of those reports. 

Hopefully that was helpful in getting you started. Best off luck and feel free to come back with your experience.

thetagang,"I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 8 the average premium per week is $1,346 with an annual projection of $69,966.

All things considered, the portfolio is up +$26,949 (+8.86%) on the year and up $95,543 (+40.54%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

——
NOTE: Regarding the options section and the $20k gains. This is what I was attempting to explain over the last several weeks as the options section was showing negative while the portfolio was displaying overall gains. The increase this week was mainly due to covered calls that I had been rolling further into the future. This was somewhat of a hedge on a potential downturn. 
——

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

I broke my streak of contributions this week. I will pick it up again soon. 

The portfolio is comprised of 94 unique tickers unchanged from last week. These 94 tickers have a value of $315k. I also have 159 open option positions, up from 152 last week. The options have a total value of $16k. The total of the shares and options is $331k. 

I’m currently utilizing $30,500 in cash secured put collateral, down from $36,800 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage. The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are down $19,648 this week and are up $76,307 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

My answer is always the same, get a Margin Account (Schwab , Tasty, IB platform not for me) , you are pissing away your leverage in a Cash Account. If you have the money (25k but 60k better) to trade options (90% of those responding only have 10k or less).

Typically the lower the stock price the lower the market cap and i try to go at least above 10B market cap as well. So that tends to put the lowest acceptable stocks in the \~$20 range.

Good starting point is to look at the S&P 500 companies as those have been vetted already, look at its chart to see if its historically been going up aka growth, or if its been sideways or down.

NOTE: Regarding the options section and the $7k loss this week. AFRM was up another 12.89% after a 21.88% surge last Friday. I own 400 shares and have 4 outstanding covers calls all with a strike of $52.5. Since AFRM is up to $80.66 today, the total return on those options is -$9,517 (-119.76%). This is because of the fact that as the underlying increases the amount to buy back the outstanding covered call with the $52.5 strike goes up as well. This means that the covered call has a growing unrealized gain as the share price appreciates. New options for 2028 come out in September. If the shares have not been assigned by then, I will look into rolling to the highest strike possible. 

I added this note to illustrate that a covered call that has its strike surpassed by share price will negatively affect this options display. Unless the option gets assigned or rolled, it will stay an unrealized loss.
——

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Added $600 in contributions to the portfolio for the 16th week in a row. This is a 44 week streak of adding at least $500.

The portfolio is comprised of 94 unique tickers up from 93 last week. These 94 tickers have a value of $356k. I also have 152 open option positions, down from 154 last week. The options have a total value of -$3k. The total of the shares and options is $353k. 

I’m currently utilizing $36,800 in cash secured put collateral, up from $35,050 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up $16,843 this week and are up $95,955 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.

thetagang,"The risk of selling CC on SPY is assignment.

You can avoid this risk by selling SPX options but this would require a higher approval level and a margin account.

SPX is the S&P 500 index, so the rate of return of a SPX call should be comparable to that of SPY.

But SPX has other benefits. See [https://www.cboe.com/tradable\_products/sp\_500/mini\_spx\_options/](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/sp_500/mini_spx_options/)

You can sell SPX calls using the value of your SPY stocks as collateral - so a SPX call is covered by the SPY stocks. But your SPY stocks cannot be called away because the SPX call is settled in cash.

SPX has a notional value 10 X of SPY, so you can sell 1 call for every 1000 shares of SPY.

For fewer shares, you can sell XSP calls, the ratio is 1 to 1. But if you have other holdings, they can be used as collateral.

thetagang,"Here are my strategies that can be used for index options.

**Papakong88's strategy #1:**

Sell 4WTE (4 weeks to expiration) NDX strangles. Delta = 0.04 for the put and 0.02 for the call.

The average premium I sold last week for Mar 7 is 42.7 (the previous week was 38). Margin required is 218 K.

**Papakong88's strategy #2:**

Sell 25HTE (25 hours to expiration) NDX ICs.

Spread = 100 to 150, premium = 1.00 to 2.00, Delta of short strike < 0.02 or use > 3 times the Expected Move (EM) to determine the short strike. EM is the ATM straddle value.



For Strategy #1, the rate of return will depend on the margin requirement. I used Schwab and their MR is equal to the minimum required by the exchange. I know some brokers have higher MR.

One can boost the return by using a higher delta. I chose those delta values because I wanted a maintenance free strategy. If you are proficient in risk management, you can use a higher delta. Many traders use a delta of 0.30 but I would not use a delta higher than 0.10.

For Strategy #2, one can double the money in less than 100 trading days. If you are uneasy then avoid days like FOMC meetings. One can use a smaller spread size if max loss is a concern. I use a 100-point spread because I can do the math in my head while it is not easy to do it with 75-point.",strategy used index option papakong strategy sell wte week expiration ndx strangles delta put call average premium sold last week mar previous week margin required k papakong strategy sell hte hour expiration ndx ic spread premium delta short strike use time expected move em determine short strike em atm straddle value strategy rate return depend margin requirement used schwab mr equal minimum required exchange know broker higher mr one boost return using higher delta chose delta value wanted maintenance free strategy proficient risk management use higher delta many trader use delta would use delta higher strategy one double money le trading day uneasy avoid day like fomc meeting one use smaller spread size max loss concern use point spread math head easy point,Comment,['SCHW'],Banks & Finance

* $100 per contract

So for the Dec 19 $960 call the premium is around $7.1 hence the margin requirement would be 10%\*357 + 7.1 = 42.8 per share. The annualized return would be around 15%.

thetagang,"I will post a separate link with the detail behind each option sold this week. 

After week 6 the average premium per week is $1,335 with an annual projection of $69,437.

All things considered, the portfolio is up +$29,097 (+9.58%) on the year and up $100,034 (+43.00%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

——
NOTE: Regarding the options section and the $9k loss this week, today specifically, was down $7k. 
AFRM was up 21.88% today. I own 400 shares and have 4 outstanding covers calls all with a strike of $52.5. Since AFRM is up to $74.98 today, the options return today was -$4,130. This is because of the fact that as the underlying increases the amount to by back the outstanding covered call with the $52.5 strike goes up as well. This means that the covered call has a growing unrealized gain as the share price appreciates. New options for 2028 come out in September. If the shares have not been assigned by then, I will look into rolling to the highest strike possible. 

Similar to the above situation, HOOD options were down $980, RDDT down $725, OKLO down $585. These were the major drivers of the -$9k.

I added this note to illustrate that a covered call that has its strike surpassed by share price will negatively affect this options display. Unless the option gets assigned or rolled, it will stay an unrealized loss.
——

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Added $600 in contributions to the portfolio for the 15th week in a row. This is a 43 week streak of adding at least $500.

The portfolio is comprised of 93 unique tickers up from 92 last week. These 92 tickers have a value of $330k. I also have 152 open option positions, down from 154 last week. The options have a total value of $3k. The total of the shares and options is $333k. 

I’m currently utilizing $35,050 in cash secured put collateral, up from $35,400 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up $9,388 this week and are up $79,112 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.

In the February 3, 2025, article ""I-Dog Capital January 2025: My Thoughts for 2025 Capital Markets"" from The Millennial Economist, author Ian provides a comprehensive update on his personal fund, I-Dog Capital, and shares his perspectives on the financial markets under President Trump's new term.

2024 Performance Recap:

Ian acknowledges the challenges faced in 2024, notably a 7.89% annual loss, primarily due to setbacks like the Intel trade in July. Despite these hurdles, he emphasizes the importance of learning from these experiences and refining strategies for future success.

January 2025 Achievements:

In January 2025, I-Dog Capital reported a 4.12% return, outperforming the S&P 500's 1.97% gain for the same period. This success is attributed to a disciplined approach focusing on:

Selling secured weekly options on well-understood, non-tech stocks such as Verizon, Dow Chemical, and Pfizer.

Prioritizing high theta premium trades at attractive underlying strike prices.

Emphasizing the importance of taking profits without chasing them.


Ian employs a strategy of selling options on full positions of 100 shares, ensuring all trades are secured and align with the parameters of his 2x margin account, targeting a 1% return per weekly trade.

Strategic Adjustments:

To optimize returns, Ian has incorporated the short-term government bond fund $BIL into his portfolio, using it as a functional clearing account due to his broker's non-interest-bearing cash account. As of January's end, he holds 11 shares of $BIL.

Future Market Outlook:

Looking ahead, Ian contemplates the potential impacts of anticipated trade policies and protective economic measures on the 2025 capital markets. He emphasizes the importance of aligning investment decisions with personal priorities, weighing the choice between holding cash and investing in assets that promise future rewards.

For a detailed breakdown of I-Dog Capital's 2025 performance and financial statements, Ian provides a link to his updated financial statements.

Ian concludes by reiterating that he is not an investment advisor and that his insights are intended to provide a glimpse into the operations of hedge funds and significant investors, hoping to add value to readers' financial perspectives.",chatgpt summarize reading wall text february article dog capital january thought capital market millennial economist author ian provides comprehensive update personal fund dog capital share perspective financial market president trump new term performance recap ian acknowledges challenge faced notably annual loss primarily due setback like intel trade july despite hurdle emphasizes importance learning experience refining strategy future success january achievement january dog capital reported return outperforming p gain period success attributed disciplined approach focusing selling secured weekly option well understood non tech stock verizon dow chemical pfizer prioritizing high theta premium trade attractive underlying strike price emphasizing importance taking profit without chasing ian employ strategy selling option full position share ensuring trade secured align parameter x margin account targeting return per weekly trade strategic adjustment optimize return ian incorporated short term government bond fund bil portfolio using functional clearing account due broker non interest bearing cash account january end hold share bil future market outlook looking ahead ian contemplates potential impact anticipated trade policy protective economic measure capital market emphasizes importance aligning investment decision personal priority weighing choice holding cash investing asset promise future reward detailed breakdown dog capital performance financial statement ian provides link updated financial statement ian concludes reiterating investment advisor insight intended provide glimpse operation hedge fund significant investor hoping add value reader financial perspective,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

thetagang,"I will post a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.

After week 5 the average premium per week is $1,270 with an annual projection of $66,030.

All things considered, the portfolio is up +$24,511 (+8.25%) on the year and up $93,586 (+41.04%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Added $600 in contributions to the portfolio for the 14th week in a row. This is a 42 week streak of adding at least $500.

The portfolio is comprised of 92 unique tickers up from 89 last week. These 92 tickers have a value of $309k. I also have 152 open option positions, down from 154 last week. The options have a total value of $12k. The total of the shares and options is $321k. 

I’m currently utilizing $35,400 in cash secured put collateral, up from $36,550 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

Performance comparison

1 year performance (365 days)
Expired Options 41.05% |*

*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage. The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up +$3,029 this week and are up +$69,724 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

Annual results:

Commissions:
I use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.

thetagang,"Hey there, and congratulations on selling your first put option. That’s a big step, and it’s great to see you taking action and learning along the way. Options trading has a lot of moving parts, and the best way to improve is by gaining hands-on experience.

I noticed that you chose an expiration that’s around ten months out. While this does mean you collected a larger premium upfront, there’s something important to consider—**time decay (theta decay)** doesn’t work in your favor much until the last few weeks before expiration. The value of an option doesn’t decline at a constant rate over time. Instead, it decays **slowly at first** and then **accelerates as expiration approaches**.

Think of an option’s time value like an ice cube melting on a counter. In the beginning, the melting is barely noticeable, but as time passes, it starts to shrink faster. Options work the same way—the most **rapid** time decay happens in the last 30 days before expiration. By selling a put with more than ten months to go, you’re holding onto an option that won’t lose much value in the near term, which means you’ll have to wait a long time before theta decay starts working in your favor.

This is why many experienced option sellers focus on expirations in the **20-45 day range**. A shorter expiration allows time decay to work more efficiently while still giving you a reasonable premium. Shorter expirations also provide more flexibility. If the trade isn’t going as planned, it’s easier to adjust or roll the position without being locked into it for months. More importantly, a shorter time frame reduces exposure to **unexpected market shifts**. A LOT can happen to a stock like NVDA over ten months, and prolonged exposure increases the risk of large price swings that could make the trade difficult to manage.

Another key consideration is **capital efficiency**. When you sell a put, you’re either tying up cash or using margin to support the trade. The longer the expiration, the longer that capital is committed, potentially limiting your ability to take advantage of new opportunities. Shorter-dated puts free up capital faster, allowing for more frequent reinvestment of profits.

That being said, every trade is a learning experience. Watching how this one plays out will give you valuable insight into how longer-dated options behave. But next time, consider experimenting with a **30-45 day expiration** and compare how it performs. You might find that you collect premium more efficiently and manage risk more effectively.

You're already on the right path by taking action and learning. Keep going, keep refining, and welcome to the world of options trading.",hey congratulation selling first put option big step great see taking action learning along way option trading lot moving part best way improve gaining hand experience noticed chose expiration around ten month mean collected larger premium upfront something important consider time decay theta decay work favor much last week expiration value option decline constant rate time instead decay slowly first accelerates expiration approach think option time value like ice cube melting counter beginning melting barely noticeable time pass start shrink faster option work way rapid time decay happens last day expiration selling put ten month go holding onto option lose much value near term mean wait long time theta decay start working favor many experienced option seller focus expiration day range shorter expiration allows time decay work efficiently still giving reasonable premium shorter expiration also provide flexibility trade going planned easier adjust roll position without locked month importantly shorter time frame reduces exposure unexpected market shift lot happen stock like nvda ten month prolonged exposure increase risk large price swing could make trade difficult manage another key consideration capital efficiency sell put either tying cash using margin support trade longer expiration longer capital committed potentially limiting ability take advantage new opportunity shorter dated put free capital faster allowing frequent reinvestment profit said every trade learning experience watching one play give valuable insight longer dated option behave next time consider experimenting day expiration compare performs might find collect premium efficiently manage risk effectively already right path taking action learning keep going keep refining welcome world option trading,Comment,['ICE'],Banks & Finance
thetagang,"I respect that you responded. But that’s not really how CSPs work. You could just as easily “recover” with the trades I proposed with a lot less risk, more flexibility, and a higher rate of return. Before you take another CSP you should calculate the rate of return prior to execution and make sure it’s beating the S&P at the very least, otherwise you’re just playing yourself.",respect responded really csps work could easily recover trade proposed lot le risk flexibility higher rate return take another csp calculate rate return prior execution make sure beating p least otherwise playing,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance
thetagang,"So there's a few things here. The put you sold can be bought and sold numerous times. This contract is not tied directly to one person. Whoever bought this put from you can sell it to someone else who can sell to someone else and so on. When an option buyer decides to exercise, the OCH( options clearing house) randomly chooses a contract, and that is the one that is assigned. 

The chance of you being assigned is low, but not impossible. 
This will vary depending on the price of the underlying stock,  if it swings up or down, and how drastically it does so.  

Without knowing what the theta is on this particular option( I'm assuming quite low), theta decay is barely a factor here. 

You have tied up $12,500 worth of captial for ~40 weeks, netting you an initial ROI of ~17%( in an ideal senario where the option expires worthless, that is).  At its basic level, this is not terrible, but it is also not great. Last year, SPY had an ROI of ~ 25% YoY, this would average ~ 19% in the same 40-week time span. If SPY were to follow the same pattern( which it most likely wont, who knows), you would net a higher ROI parking your capital in SPY directly, with no risk of assignment, while collecting dividends as well. 

You would be able to achieve a higher ROI, with less risk, selling much closer DTE, ideally OTM, and letting them expire worthless or rolling them.  

For example,  I sold a 340 CSP on Visa on Jan 30th(earnings day) with a 1DTE of Jan 31 for 3.45. The delta was something ~ .4, while the theta was greater than -4..00.  IV was extremely high,  ~93%, causing the option to be overpriced relative to historical IV.  I was confident after research that Visa would beat earnings estimates. 

Visa beat earnings estimates, and the price rose ~4 overnight. I will be able to exit my position at market open, for  ~ $0.40 for a return of $305, an ROI of 0.089%, or let it it expire worthless for an ROI of 1.01%( in an ideal world).  That is not much, granted, but multiply 1% per day times your 40 week(5 days/week) DTE, that's a whopping ~200% ROI. We obviously can not do this same play every day for 200 days straight, and I, of course, do not have a 100% win rate. But this is an example of how capital can be put to much greater use with closer DTE. 

And This is not even a very intelligent play that i made, alot of risk for a small reward, highly dependent on theta decay and IV crush as well as no surprise in earnings. But I made this call for 2 reasons, I don't mind owning Visa in the long run, and this would give me a discount over the current market price,  annddd, I am a gambling man and I hate casinos so here we are. I have enough buying power to have sold 10 of these but then the risk would be far to great and I would go from having a bit of fun to debilitating stress lol! 


My two cents, hope this helps.",thing put sold bought sold numerous time contract tied directly one person whoever bought put sell someone else sell someone else option buyer decides exercise och option clearing house randomly chooses contract one assigned chance assigned low impossible vary depending price underlying stock swing drastically without knowing theta particular option assuming quite low theta decay barely factor tied worth captial week netting initial roi ideal senario option expires worthless basic level terrible also great last year spy roi yoy would average week time span spy follow pattern likely wont know would net higher roi parking capital spy directly risk assignment collecting dividend well would able achieve higher roi le risk selling much closer dte ideally otm letting expire worthless rolling example sold csp visa jan th earnings day dte jan delta something theta greater iv extremely high causing option overpriced relative historical iv confident research visa would beat earnings estimate visa beat earnings estimate price rose overnight able exit position market open return roi let expire worthless roi ideal world much granted multiply per day time week day week dte whopping roi obviously play every day day straight course win rate example capital put much greater use closer dte even intelligent play made alot risk small reward highly dependent theta decay iv crush well surprise earnings made call reason mind owning visa long run would give discount current market price annddd gambling man hate casino enough buying power sold risk would far great would go bit fun debilitating stress lol two cent hope help,Comment,['V'],Banks & Finance

thetagang,"1. In general, most options sellers win and most options buyers lose. Do with that what you will.

2. For selling options, assuming you are not selling 50+ deltas, you can see stronger CAGRs than the market over an extended period of time. Any 1 year period is a toss up.

For example, if you are able to consistently earn about 1.5% premium per month on avg (somewhat conservative). That annualizes to ~18% annually when adjusting for a few losing trades. 

That will “Outperform” the market long term (even adjusting for taxes), but could underperform a given year like last year.

Last piece I will note here before some idiot says “The S&P returns 9-10% annually.” No it doesn’t over a long time horizon, we are well into a bull market, which artificially inflates SP historical return.

thetagang,"I came to the same conclusion a while back.

If people want to gamble for that 100x gain with their grandma's retirement fund, they need to get out of here and go back to WSB or any of those stock-related tinfoil hat subreddits and go long.

A 1% gain every 30 days is 12% on an annualized basis, which is absolutely incredible. For reference, the S&P 500 has average returns of around 8-10% annually, and anything above that is considered ""beating the market"".

As for the reason OP chose 1% of the strike as his desired return, it's because that is a very good starting point when judging risk vs reward on a particular option.

Anything lower just isn't worth the risk, and anything greater is too close to being at-the-money, and is too risky as a result.

Sure, you could get a juicy premium if you sell a strike closer to the money, but as I've said several times on this subreddit: ""If the premium is high, there's a reason why.""

On the other hand, any strike that returns 1% of the strike is an incredibly good middle ground, and should be considered if you can find it for your chosen ticker.",came conclusion back people want gamble x gain grandma retirement fund need get go back wsb stock related tinfoil hat subreddits go long gain every day annualized basis absolutely incredible reference p average return around annually anything considered beating market reason op chose strike desired return good starting point judging risk v reward particular option anything lower worth risk anything greater close money risky result sure could get juicy premium sell strike closer money said several time subreddit premium high reason hand strike return strike incredibly good middle ground considered find chosen ticker,Comment,['SPGI'],Banks & Finance

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2025-03-07.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

thetagang,"I will post a separate comment with a link that includes the detail for each option sold this week.

After week 4 the average premium per week is $1,202 with an annual projection of $62,517.

All things considered, the portfolio is up +$9,941 (+3.20%) on the year and up $93,235 (+40.99%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.

All options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.

All options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. 

Added $600 in contributions to the portfolio for the 13th week in a row. This is a 41 week streak of adding at least $500.

The portfolio is comprised of 89 unique tickers unchanged from 89 last week. These 89 tickers have a value of $303k. I also have 154 open option positions, up from 150 last week. The options have a total value of $18k. The total of the shares and options is $321k. 

I’m currently utilizing $36,550 in cash secured put collateral, up from $35,400 last week.

I sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue.

I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. 

2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS
In addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up $5,438 this week and are up $66,695 overall.
See r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.

LEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.

LEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)

thetagang,"As far as leaving profits on the table, I will give you a real life over simplified example and you can extrapolate the rest from there:

MSTR is currently about $350/share.  Let's say we wanted to sell a put $50 out of the money for Feb 21,2025, we could get a fill approximately for $12/share brining in $1200 worth of premium.  On Robinhood, this would cost you $30,000 worth of buying power to potentially collect and keep $1200. To reduce the buying power required, you could do a 100 point credit spread (short $300, long $200) and it would still cost you $10,000 worth of buying power to collect $1,100.  On the call side, if you wanted to sell a naked call $50 out of the money at strike $400, you wouldn't be able to do that on Robinhood but you can do a 100 point credit spread (short 400, long 500) and basically turn it into an Iron condor (400-500 call credit spread $2050-750= $1300) so effectively $10,000 worth of buying power can bring in a total of $2400 ($1,100 on the put side and $1300 on the call side).

Now on Schwab you can do a $50 out of the money strangle ( $300 naked put, $400 naked call) for an approximate total of $3200 credit and $7700 worth of buying power.  So on Robinhood, you would need to do a 4 leg option and tie up $10,000 to get $2400 which is 24% for approximately and on Schwab you would need a 2 leg option and tie up $7700 to get $3200 which is about 42% return.  In this example you are leaving about 75% on the table.

As far as management and rolling, on Robinhood, if you decide to roll the top and bottom to different dates that are not identical, your buying power requirement will double form 10K to 20k but with a strangle in Schwab, you can roll to different dates and the buying power will only change to the greater number of one of the sides, it will not double. 

  
As far as faster and better fills, based on personal experience and concurrence of colleagues, having used over 6 different platforms for many years, TradeStation ranks the best on fastest and best fills (on regular options, not as good on index options like spx), Schwab is a close 2nd (good on index options too) and Robinhood is dead last. If you google ""PFOF"" (Payment for Order Flow) you will get more insight into why that is. 

As far as Portfolio Margin, I am not talking about margin rate, it's a conversation about how much milage your actual money gives you as far as buying power. google ""Regulation T vs. Portfolio Margin"" to learn more.

Back to your original comments about going to a ""real broker"". I'm good with the features I get with Robinhood regardless of the dollar amount in my portfolio. I am not leaving funds on the table because I would not trade naked puts or iron condors even if I was with Schwab.

It is clear that your trading style favors Schwab and other advanced platforms. There may be some clear advantages for traders looking to capitalize on those features.   
  
The differences in execution quality or better fills are usually negligible for small trades, which is exactly what I'm doing. The savings from Robinhood’s zero-commission trades often outweigh the slight disadvantage of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF).

thetagang,"In a properly structured put credit spread (or diagonal put spread), the long put can offset a significant portion of the collateral requirement. 

When you sell a put and simultaneously buy a put with a lower strike price, the collateral requirement is typically reduced to the difference between the strike prices, multiplied by 100 shares per contract, minus the net credit received.

Example scenario:
- Sell weekly ATM put at $50 strike
- Buy 3-month put at $45 strike
- Difference between strikes = $5
- Collateral requirement would be: ($5 × 100 shares) - net premium received

This means you’re not fully exposed to the entire strike price, as the long put provides protection and reduces the margin requirement. The broker should recognize this risk mitigation and adjust the collateral accordingly.

Different brokers have varying approaches to margin calculations for put spreads, but I’ll break down how some of the major brokers typically handle this strategy:

1. Tastytrade:
- Generally considers the max potential loss
- Margin requirement = (Width of spread - Net Premium Received) × 100 shares
- Very trader-friendly calculation
- Lowest margin requirement among most brokers

2. Interactive Brokers (IBKR):
- Uses a more complex risk-based margining system
- Calculates margin using sophisticated algorithms that consider volatility
- Typically more conservative than Tastyworks
- Requires higher margin

3. TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab:
- Uses a step-by-step risk calculation
- Slightly more restrictive than Tastyworks

4. Robinhood:
- low cost approach
- Usually requires margin based on the maximum potential loss
- Less sophisticated than other platforms
