- Seasonal patterns noted, with Q3 typically being slower for RPM.
- Economic backdrop marked by low/no growth, particularly influencing construction and manufacturing sectors.

**Financial Results:**
- Consolidated sales declined by 3% year-over-year, attributed to unfavorable weather and currency translations.

**Outlook:**
- Anticipations for Q4 include flat sales with modest earnings growth expected, particularly from the Performance Coatings Group benefiting from high-performance building trends.
- The impact of tariffs on raw materials, particularly in resins and packaging, expected to escalate inflation in the mid-single digits.

Meanwhile, 10-year bond yields rising from around 4.00% to 4.20%. Could this mean investors believe that we're nearing the dip? The market was expecting the first rate cut in June, but May percentage are increasing.

High volatility day ends, but the result stays the same. The stock market closed red again and extended the losing streak to 3 days. We finally saw a few green stocks on the map. Who's going to save us from this situation? Will the Fed step in with an early rate cut or will Trump ease the impact of these tariffs?

Many people have asked about the tools I use in my previous posts. I took screenshot from Stock+ on my iPhone and iPad. It has orange icon on the App Store.

I'm way to close to being over budget after buying parts for the new rig(9800x3d and 5080 FE) but I know I want these fans in the future and need some additional cooling now so I was considering getting a 2 pack of the 140mm fans and using the shitty 4 stock ones for the time being. Later on I want to get a triple pack of the 120mm fans for the side panel and maybe a water cooler radiator mounted to the top. 

  
My question is: How do the ""rgb hub"" things work that comes with the 2 pack of 140mm fans or the 3 pack of the 120mm fans. It seems there's only 3 ports on it from the image on amazon and I'm not sure how the inputs work for into the mother board with the hub. I will be using an [ASRock AMD B850 Steel Legend WiFi 7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRTTJ5D6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title).

1jzh1e4,Quasimorph,Faction Preferences and Tier Lists?,"I'm curious as to how other people choose which factions they build up first and how they'd rank each one, so I thought I'd just write out which factions I prefer to side with and how I'd rank them in their equipment. Pretty much every playthrough I go Sunlight > Daydream/Dilthey > SBN.  
Disclaimer: This is all my own opinions from how I play and what I prefer.

S Tier

\------

Sunlight Coven - Archangel backpack is the best thing to exist in the game, no questions asked. 6x3 inventory, Servo-arm (third weapon slot w/ -1 reload AP), and -50% weight reduction allows for Dodge rating to not be tanked. Their Beam weapons are strong, but the Exorcist (20% armor pen) and Crusader (Sniper) are great, even in the endgame. Unfortunately their Prophet Pattern kinda sucks ass, SBN's Myrmidon armor is basically the exact same but slightly better, AND at a lower tech level.

Daydream Chems - Likely A-tier but I personally would put them in S-tier. Elemental weapons being Poison and Cold let you shred almost anything. Any combination of DDC's Aspid/Scadi and Dilthey's A.R.C. let you kill everything in the game, plus they can all be repaired with Hi-Tek repair kits. Poison and Cold grenades as well also massively help in damage variation. This shit SLAPS.

RealWare - I'm kinda iffy on placing RealWare on S tier, as I believe they straddle the line between low-S and high-A. The higher end guns (Sharvara, Ghost Mantis, Retribution) are all strong in their own rights, but once you get to lategame at this point imo it's better to be running elemental guns (Shock, Poison, Cold) as your main weapons. The biggest selling point of RealWare's power to me is their armor; Carnage and Warlord patterns are extremely powerful and useful to have for resistances since they have such high numbers themselves.

A Tier

\------

SBN - Electromagnetic weapons here are amazing. Consistent damage, no need for ammo (All you need is a repair kit), silencer, and have four options to choose from (You're gonna use the assault rifle each time). Armors can be mixed and matched well, Dawn Pattern is nice to round out the base 3 (Blunt, Pierce, Cut) resistances. Their equipment is just generally good.

Dilthey - Tbh the only thing I like from them is the A.R.C. (Shock SMG) and the Tempest (Ultrasound Assault Rifle). A.R.C. is a staple for me almost everywhere since it does decent damage on its own, but more importantly stunlocks enemies with Shock. I prefer this and the Stormpiercer over AnCom's Shock Pistol/Rifle due to Batteries being much more accessible and easily obtained than Igvas. Specifically, you won't be able to replenish Igvas ammo without fighting Mars/Venus Quasimorphs or AnCom, severely limiting your ammo. Batteries are able to be commonly found in loot, be picked off enemies, and even crafted yourself on a Workbench. Dilthey Batteries also allow you to stock up more ammo than usual (60 vs 40 stack limit) for a -10% tradeoff in damage but higher crit and pierce chances. The FA Scale armor kinda sucks imo, but if you need Poison and Cold resist they can help. The other Ultrasound weapons are also a good alternative for Blunt damage instead of SBN's Pierce damage from Electromagnetics.

AnCom - Overall a solid faction with strong weapons and decent equipment. They uniquely have the AEP and AEV, energy weapons that use Igvas from Quasimorph enemies to deal Shock damage. I've already explained a bit in the Dilthey section why I don't like these as much, but they are still strong guns nonetheless. Only other notable guns imo are the Storm ANCM for it's 7 ammo per shot (8 with manipulator) that can shred enemies with different 9mm bullet types. The Taiga and Barracuda shotguns imo are far inferior to the Jeffhammer, due to the 3 shot vs 4 and 10 ammo count vs 24 from a Jeffhammer respectively. The APT-Taurus is quite nice but I don't think it's very notable; it's a slightly better version of the Mantis M3 from Realware. Their armor is not bad, giving some good variety of resistances for cold/poison/beam.

B Tier

\------

Franche-Comte PS - Has a somewhat decent niche of fast reload weapons, although this quickly becomes rather pointless once you get Archangel backpacks and Rookie/Gladiator/Veteran vests. Their guns are still quite strong though and have good variety regardless. For their Battery weapons, Zeus is good for stunlocking in melee, Tremor is trash, Barrier is a slightly worse A.R.C. (due to only 3 shots vs A.R.C.'s 3/5 shots). This faction also makes the Cerberus armor set which is a very solid midgame choice for a while but will be eventually replaced through modified crafter gear from item chips.

C Tier

\------

Church of Revelation - Has good equipment, and alcohol if you prefer to keep Quasimorphosis meter down. Seraphim Pattern isn't really good, and the Jeffhammer series shotguns they provide are always nice to have if you've got ammo variety. I am personally a fan of the Jeffhammers, but they have the same issue of every other regular gun; being locked into only Blunt, Cut, Pierce, and Fire damage types which can limit usage based on enemy Quasimorphs/factions. For other weapons, their pistols suck ass and the Penance is a good Plasma weapon for Gasoline usage but otherwise feels like a sidegrade to Battery-based Plasma weapons.

Civil Resistance - Same kind of deal as Grasshopper Technologies; they just feel ""alright"". Nice weapon variety but nothing particularly stands out to me as something I'd willingly take past midgame. Armor sets are also kinda mediocre as well since many other armors outclass them. I'm putting them in C-tier for a wider range of weapons including two Battery-based Plasma guns.

D Tier

\------

Grasshopper Technologies - They're ""alright"", and that's about it. Not much so say about their equipment tbh. They're small improvements or changes from existing guns but don't really do much else apart from that. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, simply being ""alright"" will not get you very far when faction powers start ramping up and endgame comes.

F Tier

\------

Coreward MG - Only redeeming tech is the LPS Whip, infinite ammo + shreds on dual lasers w/ Manipulator augment.

PlanetBridge - Similar to Coreward, only two good items, the Thunderstorm (Shock machine gun) and Enigma Supreme (Electromagnetic Sniper). Thunderstorm is quite nice for a Battery-based Shock weapon, but Dilthey's A.R.C. is more preferable due to multiple things: lower weight, faster reload (3 AP vs 6), no Painful Crits trait. It's still very good at straight up killing enemies though with it's sheer fire rate and damage. Enigma Supreme isn't bad per se as an electromagnetic sniper, but it's still kinda meh when you have other options available. With the Manipulator augment to give it another projectile it is quite nice to use.

Tezctlan/Feathered Masks - Don't think I really need to say much about this one. No Pierce resists on armors is just asking to be made into Swiss cheese for even basic enemies. Limited tech overall.

Don't Know How To Rank Tier

\------

Unchained Belt - I have never gotten them to a high technology point nor have I taken many missions for/against, so I'm unsure of what tier to put them in. I just know that their guns except for the Baracuda (the only gun in the game to use 12.7 ammo, same name as AnCom's Barracuda shotgun but one less ""r""), which I haven't gotten to test, is that at all are slightly worse versions of existing variants.

Shedu's Thousand - Haven't gotten far enough in saves to really get much from them. Only gun I've used from here is the Sting, and it's more like Stink because it is ASS.",faction preferences tier lists,im curious people choose factions build first theyd rank one thought id write

1jwz8m2,StockMarket,"Week Recap: The stock market had passed a highly volatile week and ended positive both daily and weekly. Is the worst behind us? Apr. 4, 2025 - Apr. 11, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Apr. 4 to Apr. 11. 

I had the same question that ""Is the worst behind us?"" in March 15. The S&P 500 closed 5,638.94 that week. And today, it has closed at 5,358.75. But this time, could it be different?

It has been a busy week, and also a highly volatile one. The S&P500's daily closing percentages were -0.23%, -1.57%, +9.52%, -3.46%, +1.72%.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: Last week, we saw major losses after the tariff announcements. Asian markets opened with heavy selling pressure. The Hang Seng Index dropped 13% in a single day. Thailand temporarily banned short selling of stocks. This week started under similar pressure. Althouth there was no major news for the market, but it rebounded and recovered more than 3% its loses. The day ended slightly negative. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, ""Up to 70 nations want to negotiate over Trump's tariffs"". This boosted the market and opened up by around 2.5%. However, the momentum could not continue. The White House later announced that Trump is not considering any extensions or delays. All gains were erased and the market dropped more than 1.5% 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Here we go. The stock market opened slightly lower and then came big news. Trump signaled a 90-day pause on tariffs, but China's tariff rate will jump to 125%. The stock market focused on the first part and made a huge jump and gained more than 10%. What a day. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: CPI inflation was released and came in below expectations, but investors remembered China's tarrifs and took profits. The stock market lost more than 3%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: PPI inflation had released and similar to CPI, it came below expectations. The monthly expectation was 0.2%, but it came -0.4%. This result caused to the yearly rate to drop to 2.7%. The yearly dropped below 3% since November 2024. This is very positive for the stock market because it increases the chances of more rate cuts. The first one could come in May, but prohability is still low. On the negative side, The US10Y (10-year treasury) hit 4.60 and the highest level since Feb. 13. The stock market is expecting the first rate cut in June. The last day of the week ended on a positive. 🟢

The 2-week losing streak has ended. Week by week,

On Monday, the S&P 500 hit its lowest level of this week at 4,835.04. Was that the dip? I saw a tariff alert on a news app on Wednesday and I bought around 5150.

* 📜 **Show clients their full range of options** Guide, don’t push — and earn long-term trust.
* 📆 **Schedule Q1 appointments during AEP** Stay top of mind after enrollment season ends.

Energy and defensive sectors (consumer defensive, utilities) show strength, while technology, consumer cyclical, and basic materials face headwinds. U.S. markets are mixed, with labor resilience offset by housing weakness. Globally, Europe and Asia brace for growth slowdowns, but commodities remain robust. Investors should monitor trade talk progress and sector-specific earnings for further clarity.

1k1i7gf,TickerTalkByLiam,Mainz Biomed ($MYNZ): A Quiet Contender in the Colorectal Cancer Diagnostics Space,"Mainz Biomed (NASDAQ: MYNZ) is a small-cap biotech firm specializing in molecular diagnostics, with a particular focus on early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Their lead product is **ColoAlert**, an **at-home, stool-based mRNA test** designed to identify both colorectal cancer and advanced precancerous lesions.

Most investors in this space know the big names:

* **Exact Sciences (EXAS)** offers a DNA-based stool test (Cologuard)
* **Guardant Health (GH)** provides a blood-based CRC screening (Guardant Shield)

But Mainz takes a different approach — leveraging **mRNA biomarkers**, which may offer higher precision, especially when it comes to catching CRC early and detecting **advanced adenomas**.



# 🔍 Why It Matters:

In clinical trials, **ColoAlert delivered**:

* **94% sensitivity for CRC**
* **88% specificity**
* **Stronger detection rates for high-risk polyps vs. traditional tests**

This makes the test compelling not just for its accuracy, but also because it’s **non-invasive** and designed for home use — an important factor for improving screening compliance.

# 🧪 Where Things Stand:

Mainz is actively enrolling patients in the **REVEAL trial**, which is a pivotal study aimed at securing FDA approval for ColoAlert in the U.S. If successful, this could place MYNZ in direct competition with EXAS in a multi-billion-dollar market.

The company has also secured key partnerships with **Thermo Fisher Scientific** and **Quest Diagnostics** to support U.S.-based lab infrastructure and distribution, giving them a potential runway to scale fast.

  
**Bottom Line:** MYNZ is quietly positioning itself as a challenger in the CRC screening field. With differentiated tech, compelling trial results, and U.S. commercialization in sight, it's a name worth keeping on your biotech watchlist.

1k15d92,EverHint,"[Risky, Momentum_3d] Top 3 Stock Analysis based on momentum_3d (April 16, 2025)","Hey r/EverHint!

I’ve dug into the data and crunched the numbers to bring you an analysis of some high-momentum stocks as of April 16, 2025. These picks are based on financial metrics and OHLCV data, using a momentum strategy with a 3-day lookback period. I’ll also give you a quick rundown of the market context, compare these stocks to their sector peers, and recommend up to five stocks with solid reasoning. Let’s get started!

# Market Context

The broader market has been a bit of a rollercoaster over the past 10 trading days. Major indices like the S&P 500 (\^GSPC), Dow Jones (\^DJI), and Nasdaq (\^IXIC) have shown a slightly bearish trend with noticeable volatility—think ups and downs that keep investors on their toes. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) have been their usual wild selves, swinging sharply, which might spill over into tech or blockchain-related stocks. On the commodity front, oil prices (CL=F) have fluctuated, potentially affecting energy stocks, while gold (GC=F) has stayed relatively steady—a classic safe haven amid uncertainty. The USD index (DX-Y.NYB) has edged up slightly, which could pressure companies with big overseas revenues. All in all, it’s a choppy environment out there!

# Stock Recommendations

After analyzing the pre-screened stocks, I’ve narrowed it down to three picks that balance momentum, valuation, and growth potential. These are high-risk, high-reward plays, so buckle up! Here’s why I chose them:

# 1. BYRN - Byrna Technologies, Inc. (Industrials)

* **Reasoning:** BYRN is on fire with a 3-day momentum of 19.02%, blowing past its sector average of 7.08%. It’s got strong revenue growth at 57% and an eye-popping earnings growth of 93.09% (though that figure might be a bit inflated—still, growth is impressive). The after-hours bump of 1.69% shows investors are still excited. Compared to sector peers, BYRN’s momentum stands out; for instance, giants like GE only managed a -1.73% daily change. However, its forward P/E of 60.97 is steep, so it’s priced for perfection—any slip-up could hurt.

# 2. TRGP - Targa Resources, Inc. (Energy)

* **Reasoning:** TRGP boasts a 3-day momentum of 5.58%, well above its sector average of 2.80%. Its forward P/E of 20.91 is reasonable for energy, and it’s backed by modest revenue (4%) and earnings (17%) growth. A strong 1.92% after-hours gain signals solid sentiment. Compared to peers like XOM (1.06% daily change), TRGP’s outperformance is clear, especially with oil prices bouncing around. It’s a solid pick in a volatile sector.

# 3. APTV - Aptiv PLC (Consumer Cyclical)

* **Reasoning:** APTV’s forward P/E of 7.27 and current P/E of 7.28 scream value, with a 3-day momentum of 5.82% edging out the sector average of 5.25%. The 1.50% after-hours gain is a nice bonus. However, stagnant revenue and a -65% earnings drop raise red flags—though the low P/E suggests the market’s already priced this in. Compared to peers like TSLA (-4.94% daily), APTV’s stability shines, but its growth woes need watching.

# Sector Comparison Notes

* **Industrials:** BYRN’s 19.02% momentum dwarfs the sector’s 7.08% average and peers like CAT (-1.12% daily). It’s a standout, but its high valuation is a risk.
* **Energy:** TRGP’s 5.58% beats the 2.80% sector average and outperforms XOM or CVX (0.61% daily), aligning well with oil’s ups and downs.
* **Consumer Cyclical:** APTV’s 5.82% tops the 5.25% average, holding steady against AMZN (-2.93%) or HD (-2.29%), though its negative growth contrasts with LOVE’s mixed metrics.

# Caution

Trading high-risk stocks like these can be a wild ride! They’re volatile and sensitive to market shifts, especially with ongoing tariff wars that could flip sector trends fast. What looks hot today might cool off tomorrow, so tread carefully and keep your risk tolerance in check.

# Final Thoughts

These picks—BYRN, TRGP, and APTV—offer a mix of momentum and potential upside, but they’re not without risks. BYRN’s growth is stellar, TRGP rides energy waves, and APTV could be a bargain if it turns around. Keep an eye on sector trends, as tariff wars could shake things up quickly. Always do your own research before diving in!

This report analyzes midday news from the past 12 hours, leveraging provided CSV files to assess the tariffs’ impact on U.S. and global economies.

- **U.S.**: Single-family housing starts fell to an eight-month low, depressed by tariffs (Economic Indicators News, 11 hours ago). Initial jobless claims dipped, signaling labor market stability (Economic Indicators News, 11 hours ago).
- **Global**: Japan’s core inflation accelerated, complicating BOJ’s rate path (Economic Indicators News, 10 minutes ago). The IMF expects growth markdowns but no global recession (Business and Economic News, 9 hours ago).
- **Sentiment**: Mixed; U.S. labor resilience is positive, but housing and global growth concerns weigh.

We analyze trends:
- **U.S. Indices**: The Dow Jones (^DJI) closed at 39,669.39 on April 16, down 1.33% from 40,179.50, reflecting tariff-driven volatility. The S&P 500 futures (ES=F) fell to 5,310.25, a 2.12% drop from April 16’s high of 5,425.00. The VIX (^VIX) at 30.42 indicates elevated market fear.
- **Asian Markets**: China’s SSE Composite (000001.SS) rose to 3,280.34 (+0.13%), showing resilience. Japan’s Nikkei futures (^XDN) gained to 70.22 (+0.13%), but tariff concerns linger.
- **European Markets**: The STOXX 50 (^STOXX50E) dropped to 4,935.34 (-0.63%), reflecting ECB rate cuts and tariff fears. The FTSE 100 (^BUK100P) edged up to 824.58 (+0.09%).
- **Commodities**: Gold futures (GC=F) at $3,305.20 and silver (SI=F) at $32.45 remain near highs, driven by safe-haven demand. Oil (CL=F) at $64.28 (+2.38%) reflects supply concerns.
- **Currencies**: EUR/USD at 1.1374 (+0.78%) weakened slightly, while USD/CNY at 7.2985 (-0.09%) stabilized.
- **Bonds**: U.S. 10-year yields (^TNX) at 4.333% are steady, but 30-year yields (^TYX) at 4.809% suggest inflation expectations.

**Trend Summary**: Markets are volatile, with U.S. equities and bonds under pressure. Commodities like gold and oil are strong, reflecting safe-haven and supply dynamics. Asian markets show cautious stability, while European markets weaken.

## Sector Sentiment (U.S. Focus)
Using `combined_sector_data_2025-04-17.csv`, we assess sector performance and tariff impacts:
- **Technology**: Down 0.56% (e.g., NVDA -2.87%, INTC -1.56%). Tariffs on chips and rare earths disrupt supply chains. **Sentiment**: Negative.
- **Healthcare**: Mixed, with LLY +14.30% but UNH -22.38% and HUM -13%. Tariff-related cost pressures hit managed care. **Sentiment**: Neutral to negative.
- **Energy**: Up 1.98% (e.g., XOM +2.62%, CVX +1.85%). Oil price gains and supply concerns boost sentiment. **Sentiment**: Positive.
- **Consumer Cyclical**: Down 0.32% (e.g., TSLA -0.07%, BABA +2.02%). Tariff costs pressure retailers and automakers. **Sentiment**: Negative.
- **Financial Services**: Up 0.41% (e.g., JPM +1.02%, SCHW +0.59%). Strong earnings from Schwab and AmEx offset tariff uncertainty. **Sentiment**: Neutral.
- **Industrials**: Up 0.72% (e.g., CAT +1.42%, UNP +1.69%). Logistics may benefit from port fee easing. **Sentiment**: Neutral to positive.

## International Sector Sentiment
- **Technology (Global)**: TSMC’s bullish outlook offsets tariff uncertainty, but BofA cut its price target (Stock Market News, 9 hours ago). **Sentiment**: Neutral.
- **Consumer Goods (Europe)**: L’Oréal’s Q1 sales beat expectations, but U.S. market challenges persist (Stock Market News, 3 hours ago). **Sentiment**: Neutral.

## Interesting Fact
Despite tariff pressures, the energy sector’s resilience is notable, with oil prices hitting a two-week high (CL=F at $64.28). This contrasts with expectations of broader commodity weakness, highlighting geopolitical and supply-driven dynamics outweighing trade concerns.

## Conclusion
The Trump administration’s tariffs continue to drive market volatility, with U.S.-China trade talks and global policy responses shaping sentiment. Energy and defensive sectors (consumer defensive, utilities) show strength, while technology, consumer cyclical, and basic materials face headwinds. U.S. markets are mixed, with labor resilience offset by housing weakness. Globally, Europe and Asia brace for growth slowdowns, but commodities remain robust. Investors should monitor trade talk progress and sector-specific earnings for further clarity.

1k15d92,EverHint,"[Risky, Momentum_3d] Top 3 Stock Analysis based on momentum_3d (April 16, 2025)","Hey r/EverHint!

I’ve dug into the data and crunched the numbers to bring you an analysis of some high-momentum stocks as of April 16, 2025. These picks are based on financial metrics and OHLCV data, using a momentum strategy with a 3-day lookback period. I’ll also give you a quick rundown of the market context, compare these stocks to their sector peers, and recommend up to five stocks with solid reasoning. Let’s get started!

# Market Context

The broader market has been a bit of a rollercoaster over the past 10 trading days. Major indices like the S&P 500 (\^GSPC), Dow Jones (\^DJI), and Nasdaq (\^IXIC) have shown a slightly bearish trend with noticeable volatility—think ups and downs that keep investors on their toes. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) have been their usual wild selves, swinging sharply, which might spill over into tech or blockchain-related stocks. On the commodity front, oil prices (CL=F) have fluctuated, potentially affecting energy stocks, while gold (GC=F) has stayed relatively steady—a classic safe haven amid uncertainty. The USD index (DX-Y.NYB) has edged up slightly, which could pressure companies with big overseas revenues. All in all, it’s a choppy environment out there!

# Stock Recommendations

After analyzing the pre-screened stocks, I’ve narrowed it down to three picks that balance momentum, valuation, and growth potential. These are high-risk, high-reward plays, so buckle up! Here’s why I chose them:

# 1. BYRN - Byrna Technologies, Inc. (Industrials)

* **Reasoning:** BYRN is on fire with a 3-day momentum of 19.02%, blowing past its sector average of 7.08%. It’s got strong revenue growth at 57% and an eye-popping earnings growth of 93.09% (though that figure might be a bit inflated—still, growth is impressive). The after-hours bump of 1.69% shows investors are still excited. Compared to sector peers, BYRN’s momentum stands out; for instance, giants like GE only managed a -1.73% daily change. However, its forward P/E of 60.97 is steep, so it’s priced for perfection—any slip-up could hurt.

# 2. TRGP - Targa Resources, Inc. (Energy)

* **Reasoning:** TRGP boasts a 3-day momentum of 5.58%, well above its sector average of 2.80%. Its forward P/E of 20.91 is reasonable for energy, and it’s backed by modest revenue (4%) and earnings (17%) growth. A strong 1.92% after-hours gain signals solid sentiment. Compared to peers like XOM (1.06% daily change), TRGP’s outperformance is clear, especially with oil prices bouncing around. It’s a solid pick in a volatile sector.

# 3. APTV - Aptiv PLC (Consumer Cyclical)

* **Reasoning:** APTV’s forward P/E of 7.27 and current P/E of 7.28 scream value, with a 3-day momentum of 5.82% edging out the sector average of 5.25%. The 1.50% after-hours gain is a nice bonus. However, stagnant revenue and a -65% earnings drop raise red flags—though the low P/E suggests the market’s already priced this in. Compared to peers like TSLA (-4.94% daily), APTV’s stability shines, but its growth woes need watching.

# Sector Comparison Notes

* **Industrials:** BYRN’s 19.02% momentum dwarfs the sector’s 7.08% average and peers like CAT (-1.12% daily). It’s a standout, but its high valuation is a risk.
* **Energy:** TRGP’s 5.58% beats the 2.80% sector average and outperforms XOM or CVX (0.61% daily), aligning well with oil’s ups and downs.
* **Consumer Cyclical:** APTV’s 5.82% tops the 5.25% average, holding steady against AMZN (-2.93%) or HD (-2.29%), though its negative growth contrasts with LOVE’s mixed metrics.

# Caution

Trading high-risk stocks like these can be a wild ride! They’re volatile and sensitive to market shifts, especially with ongoing tariff wars that could flip sector trends fast. What looks hot today might cool off tomorrow, so tread carefully and keep your risk tolerance in check.

# Final Thoughts

These picks—BYRN, TRGP, and APTV—offer a mix of momentum and potential upside, but they’re not without risks. BYRN’s growth is stellar, TRGP rides energy waves, and APTV could be a bargain if it turns around. Keep an eye on sector trends, as tariff wars could shake things up quickly. Always do your own research before diving in!

1k0ppcz,dividends,Which dividend-oriented portfolio would you choose? Global core + 4 stocks vs. full stock picking,"Hi everyone! I’m a long-term dividend-focused investor and I’m considering two possible portfolio structures. Would love your feedback on which one you think is more effective or sustainable over time.

# 🅰️ Portfolio A – Core ETFs + Defensive Dividend Picks

A clean and globally diversified setup using ETFs with a few high-quality individual stocks as a “shield” for income and stability:

* **40%** Amundi Prime All Country World UCITS ETF *(IE0009HF1MK9)* – total global exposure, very low TER (0.07%)
* **40%** VanEck Morningstar Developed Markets Dividend Leaders UCITS ETF *(TDIV – IE00BQQP9H09)* – dividend-focused, developed markets
* **5%** Realty Income *(O)* – monthly dividend REIT
* **5%** Johnson & Johnson *(JNJ)* – healthcare defensive
* **5%** Coca-Cola *(KO)* – reliable dividend payer
* **5%** Visa *(V)* – strong dividend growth, low payout

🎯 **Goal**: Simplicity, global diversification, and a few solid companies as a dividend “shield.”

# 🅱️ Portfolio B – 30% TDIV + 70% Dividend Stock Picking

Here I’d use TDIV for ETF-based stability, but keep most of the exposure in a handpicked selection of dividend-focused stocks:

* **30%** TDIV (UCITS version – IE00BQQP9H09)
* **7%** Johnson & Johnson *(JNJ)*
* **7%** Coca-Cola *(KO)*
* **7%** Altria Group *(MO)*
* **7%** Main Street Capital *(MAIN)*
* **7%** JPMorgan Chase *(JPM)*
* **7%** Chevron *(CVX)*
* **7%** Microsoft *(MSFT)*
* **7%** Visa *(V)*
* **7%** AbbVie *(ABBV)*
* **7%** Realty Income *(O)*

🎯 **Goal**: Mix of ETF safety with more personalized dividend stock exposure. Slightly more involved but still diversified by sector.

# ❓What would you choose and why?

* Is Portfolio A too passive or too ETF-heavy?
* Is Portfolio B too active or overexposed to individual stock risk?
* Any stocks you’d replace or rebalance?

1jzrk29,LNGshippingStocks,LNG shipping stocks: Week of returns,"# Summary 

In a week marked by significant political developments in the U.S., market sentiment responded with surprising optimism, pushing indices higher. The UP World LNG Shipping Index (UPI) gained 3.03% to close at 154.17 points.

This optimism was evident in the performance of UPI constituents. Strong trading volumes, particularly in the U.S. and Japan, propelled several companies to double-digit gains. Golar LNG led the surge with a 21.4% increase, followed by Tsakos Energy Navigation, Cool Company, and Flex LNG. Meanwhile, Japanese LNG stocks rebounded from early losses, ending modestly higher. However, not all fared well—Capital Clean Energy Carriers and major gas-oil firms like BP and Chevron saw notable declines.

# UPI & SPX 

The UP World LNG Shipping Index, which tracks listed LNG shipping companies, gained 4.54 points (3.03%), closing at 154.17 points, while the S&P 500 index gained by 5.70%. The chart below illustrates the performance of both indices with weekly data.

[Week 15-2025: Chart of the UP World LNG Shipping Index with S&P 500 \(Source: UP-Indices\)](https://preview.redd.it/ce9m4i2k00ve1.png?width=1871&format=png&auto=webp&s=0862e4ca9d7337eb9ce749a541428b33f864c414)

# Broader view 

The past week has brought the most dramatic changes in the new US administration's attitudes yet. This, of course, brought with it unprecedented volatility and confusion, which is probably the goal of these beautiful manoeuvres. Nevertheless, the markets were captivated by the fact that the latest decision was positive for them and ended the week higher.

LNG flows will change depending on how the tariff situation plays out, but consumption will remain the same and continue to grow. Therefore, despite the uncertainty, we maintain a positive outlook.

# Constituents 

We have called this commentary a week of returns, describing what is happening on stock markets and trading tariffs. After negative openings, there may have been too much growth, but that matter will be confirmed or not in the short term. What is important is the strong growth in trading volume, which has reached a level where it has only been six times in the history of the UPI. Most of the above-average volume has been in the US and Japan. Price movements matched the volume, with four American-listed companies achieving double-digit gains.

Golar LNG (NYQ: GLNG) added the most, 21.4%, followed by Tsakos Energy Navigation (NYQ: TEN), which rose 15.6%.

Cool Company (NYQ/OSE: CLCO) was third in growth with a 12 per cent increase, and Flex LNG (NYQ/OSE: FLNG) was fourth with a 10 per cent increase. Due to the weakening dollar, both CLCO and FLNG will see higher growth in the US than in the Norwegian stock market. This could be an interesting feature, especially if FLNG rethinks its withdrawal from the OSE due to unexpected developments.

New Fortress Energy (NYQ: NFE) rose 8.1% and Excelerate Energy (NYQ: EE) added 5.5%. Awilco LNG (OSE: ALNG) ended a volatile week with a five per cent gain.

Although Japanese stocks achieved above-average volumes, it was a weak week on a percentage basis. But let's make no mistake! The small weekly result hides a big weekly move as Japanese stocks opened with a negative gap. As a result, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (TSE: 9104), ""K"" Line (TSE: 9107), and NYK Line (TSE: 9101) returned to previous levels and ended the week up 3.8%, 2.5%, and 1.2%, respectively. Incidentally, Nakilat (QSE: QGTS) was similarly up 0.3%.

The most significant decline befell Capital Clean Energy Carriers (NYQ: CCEC), which lost seven per cent. That may speak to a good outcome, as its price was down to early 2024, which would be a loss of over twenty per cent.

The gas-oil trio did not fare as well. BP (NYQ: BP) wrote off 6.3 per cent, Chevron (NYQ: CVX) fell 5.3 per cent, and Shell (NYQ: SHEL) lost 3.2 per cent.

Dynagas LNG Partners (NYQ: DLNG) dropped 3.1% below last year's support but not to the bottom. It is in a low-volume area, as the only value traded (in this move) was last April's doji. 

# Crystal Ball

Despite the growing global uncertainty caused by the US administration, our outlook remains cautiously optimistic. However, we expect increased volatility in the coming weeks. LNG spot rates stayed low, but the impact remains marginal for most UPI constituents. The market is watching for potential breakouts at key resistance levels, which could determine the next price direction.

Our outlook remains steadfastly positive in the long term. The burgeoning demand for LNG, bolstered by situational or management-driven actions and the potential for new long-term contracts, paints a promising picture. Investors should watch policy developments, market competition, and upcoming corporate earnings for further direction.

1jyfjnr,BeginningOfInvesting,"Stock Market Predictions for the Week of April 14– What’s Set to Rise, What to Avoid, and Where to Buy the Dip”","Hey everyone,

Tomorrow marks the start of a brand new trading week, and there’s a lot to keep an eye on. Here’s a quick overview of what could impact the markets and where opportunities might lie — whether you’re a buyer, seller, or just watching the action unfold.

⸻

Market Overview:

Last week, we saw a bit of a mixed bag — the S&P 500 hovered near all-time highs while tech took a breather after a strong run. Inflation concerns are still floating around, but with the Fed hinting at possible rate cuts in the coming months, bulls are staying optimistic.

Key Things to Watch This Week:
	•	Earnings Season: Big names like Goldman Sachs, Netflix, and Johnson & Johnson are reporting this week. Strong earnings could fuel bullish momentum.
	•	Economic Data: Keep an eye out for retail sales numbers and industrial production reports. These will give more insight into consumer strength and economic activity.
	•	Geopolitics & Oil: Tensions in the Middle East could still affect oil prices, so energy stocks may be volatile.

⸻

Potential Movers This Week:

Likely to Go Up:
	•	Energy Stocks (XOM, CVX): Oil is still on the rise — energy might follow.
	•	Financials (GS, JPM): With earnings coming in, banks could see a boost if results beat expectations.
	•	Tech Comeback (NVDA, AMD): After a brief pullback, chip stocks might rebound, especially if AI headlines dominate again.

Be Cautious / Possible Pullbacks:
	•	Consumer Staples (PG, KO): Could face pressure if inflation data surprises to the upside.
	•	Real Estate & REITs: Sensitive to rate speculation — if rates look sticky, these might dip.

⸻

Strategy Thoughts:
	•	Buy the Dip? If we see early week weakness in tech, it might be a good chance to pick up discounted names.
	•	Watch for Rotation: Investors might shift from growth to value plays if earnings disappoint.
	•	Risk Management: Keep an eye on global news. Volatility is still in play — trailing stop losses could be a smart move.

⸻

1jwz8m2,StockMarket,"Week Recap: The stock market had passed a highly volatile week and ended positive both daily and weekly. Is the worst behind us? Apr. 4, 2025 - Apr. 11, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Apr. 4 to Apr. 11. 

I had the same question that ""Is the worst behind us?"" in March 15. The S&P 500 closed 5,638.94 that week. And today, it has closed at 5,358.75. But this time, could it be different?

It has been a busy week, and also a highly volatile one. The S&P500's daily closing percentages were -0.23%, -1.57%, +9.52%, -3.46%, +1.72%.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: Last week, we saw major losses after the tariff announcements. Asian markets opened with heavy selling pressure. The Hang Seng Index dropped 13% in a single day. Thailand temporarily banned short selling of stocks. This week started under similar pressure. Althouth there was no major news for the market, but it rebounded and recovered more than 3% its loses. The day ended slightly negative. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, ""Up to 70 nations want to negotiate over Trump's tariffs"". This boosted the market and opened up by around 2.5%. However, the momentum could not continue. The White House later announced that Trump is not considering any extensions or delays. All gains were erased and the market dropped more than 1.5% 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Here we go. The stock market opened slightly lower and then came big news. Trump signaled a 90-day pause on tariffs, but China's tariff rate will jump to 125%. The stock market focused on the first part and made a huge jump and gained more than 10%. What a day. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: CPI inflation was released and came in below expectations, but investors remembered China's tarrifs and took profits. The stock market lost more than 3%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: PPI inflation had released and similar to CPI, it came below expectations. The monthly expectation was 0.2%, but it came -0.4%. This result caused to the yearly rate to drop to 2.7%. The yearly dropped below 3% since November 2024. This is very positive for the stock market because it increases the chances of more rate cuts. The first one could come in May, but prohability is still low. On the negative side, The US10Y (10-year treasury) hit 4.60 and the highest level since Feb. 13. The stock market is expecting the first rate cut in June. The last day of the week ended on a positive. 🟢

1jyfd3m,thestallionvibe,$JPM Sees Institutional Investor Buying While Multiple Stocks Gap Down,"Altman Advisors Inc. increased its holdings in $JPMorgan Chase & Co. by 0.8% during the 4th quarter, acquiring an additional 70 shares. This move comes as several other stocks experience significant gaps down, raising questions about market sentiment and future performance.

Among the stocks that saw their shares gap down are $IBP, $BALY, $SW, $ABBNY, and $UAN. MarketBeat reports that these gaps have investors wondering if it's time to sell. Similarly, $SHW, $MS, and $HTZ have also seen their shares gap down, adding to the list of stocks under scrutiny.

On the flip side, institutional investors are making strategic moves. Savvy Advisors Inc. increased its stake in $COST by 233.1%, while 3Chopt Investment Partners LLC lifted its holdings in $BAC by 12.3%. These moves indicate confidence in these specific stocks despite the broader market volatility.

Additionally, $Visa Inc. saw Brogan Financial Inc. increase its stake by 10.2%, and $Sagespring Wealth Partners LLC made a new investment in $Invesco QQQ. These institutional activities suggest a selective approach to investing, focusing on stocks that show strong fundamentals or growth potential.

1jwz8m2,StockMarket,"Week Recap: The stock market had passed a highly volatile week and ended positive both daily and weekly. Is the worst behind us? Apr. 4, 2025 - Apr. 11, 2025","First of all, I don’t want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from Apr. 4 to Apr. 11. 

I had the same question that ""Is the worst behind us?"" in March 15. The S&P 500 closed 5,638.94 that week. And today, it has closed at 5,358.75. But this time, could it be different?

It has been a busy week, and also a highly volatile one. The S&P500's daily closing percentages were -0.23%, -1.57%, +9.52%, -3.46%, +1.72%.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: Last week, we saw major losses after the tariff announcements. Asian markets opened with heavy selling pressure. The Hang Seng Index dropped 13% in a single day. Thailand temporarily banned short selling of stocks. This week started under similar pressure. Althouth there was no major news for the market, but it rebounded and recovered more than 3% its loses. The day ended slightly negative. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, ""Up to 70 nations want to negotiate over Trump's tariffs"". This boosted the market and opened up by around 2.5%. However, the momentum could not continue. The White House later announced that Trump is not considering any extensions or delays. All gains were erased and the market dropped more than 1.5% 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Here we go. The stock market opened slightly lower and then came big news. Trump signaled a 90-day pause on tariffs, but China's tariff rate will jump to 125%. The stock market focused on the first part and made a huge jump and gained more than 10%. What a day. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: CPI inflation was released and came in below expectations, but investors remembered China's tarrifs and took profits. The stock market lost more than 3%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: PPI inflation had released and similar to CPI, it came below expectations. The monthly expectation was 0.2%, but it came -0.4%. This result caused to the yearly rate to drop to 2.7%. The yearly dropped below 3% since November 2024. This is very positive for the stock market because it increases the chances of more rate cuts. The first one could come in May, but prohability is still low. On the negative side, The US10Y (10-year treasury) hit 4.60 and the highest level since Feb. 13. The stock market is expecting the first rate cut in June. The last day of the week ended on a positive. 🟢

1jwetf7,dividends,Accidental dividend investor looking for advice on next move,I worked for Sherwin-Williams for a few years after college and the majority of my rollover IRA is invested in SHW since I received shares during my work there. At some point (not even sure when) it looks like it turned into paying dividends and now I have about $11k available to trade or cash out (I believe from the dividends I made from SHW). I have been wanting to diversify and invest some of this into more dividend stocks. Since this seems to be a good time to buy while stocks are low (I understand they may potentially go lower) I’m looking into DCA and investing some of it now and waiting to invest the rest. I’ve done research into some of the most popular dividend stocks to buy like SCHD and VOO but not really sure how much I should start with. I am currently 38. Any helpful advice appreciated. Thank you! ,accidental dividend investor looking advice next move,worked sherwinwilliams years college majority rollover ira invested shw since received shares work point even sure looks like turned paying dividends k available trade cash believe dividends made shw wanting diversify invest dividend stocks since seems good time buy stocks low understand may potentially go lower im looking dca investing waiting invest rest ive done research popular dividend stocks buy like schd voo really sure much start currently helpful advice appreciated thank,0.75,Discussion,['SHW'],negative,0.9999598264694214,negative,0.9324660301208496

1k1bn78,Optionmillionaires,🎯👀👀👀👀👀🎯🎯👓👓👓👓👓👁‍🗨🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪,"Russia is working on a legal framework for foreign companies to re-enter the country, amid hopes that Western sanctions will eventually be lifted. While companies are exploring options to return and carrying out due diligence, many are wary of making concrete plans till a permanent Russia-Ukraine peace deal is reached.

Conditions apply: Russia's finance ministry has been drafting a legal framework for foreign companies seeking to return to the country, which will reportedly include requirements for localizing some production and agreeing to technology transfers. To maintain their competitive advantage, Russian businesses would also be given a say on international companies returning to certain sectors.

Many companies sold their Russian subsidiaries after Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The deals included buyback clauses, which would enable them to reclaim the assets at a cheaper price. ""All new investors who want to come to Russia will receive the most favorable working conditions,"" Anatoly Aksakov, head of the financial markets parliamentary committee, told Bloomberg. But companies that exited Russia will have to pay full market prices to reclaim the assets they sold, he added.

Gearing up: Italian heating systems maker Ariston is set to resume operations in Russia after it was given back control of its local unit, which had been placed under the temporary control of Gazprom. South Korea's LG Electronics reportedly restarted operations at its plant near Moscow, while Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMTF) and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) are said to be assessing the feasibility of operating in a post-war Russian market.

Day-by-Day Standouts;

🔸 Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‘Liberation Day’ events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn’t respond well and selling pressure intensified. 🔴

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China’s response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can’t afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn’t make any trades this week. What’s your prediction for next week?

My summary ends here, but many people have asked about tools that I use. I wanted to share them. If you're not interested, feel free to skip this part. :)

🔸 Stock+: It's a mobile app where I take my screenshots. I'm using it on my iPhone and iPad. It's available on the App Store. It has an orange icon. If you're using Android, you can try to search ""Heat map"" or ""Stock map"" on the Google Play. I don't know that this app available on the Google Play, but you can find alternatives.

🔸 TradingView: I think, it's the best technical analysis tool. I'm using the web version. I'm still learning technical analysis. Yahoo Finance can be another alternative.

🔸 CME FedWatch: You can search via that keyword on Google. This website is under the CME Group. They're collecting analysts expectation about upcoming Fed rate decisions. You can check projections to 2026 December.

jsgx8d,stocks,Market and Options Summary for Nov-11-2020,"## Daily Synopsis 
* The S&P 500 eked out a gain of +0.74% today while the NASDaq added (+2.32%). The Russell 2000 closed lower by (-0.04%). The Dow ended in negative territory at (-0.14%)
* The best performing sector was Information Technology(+2.37%) while Materials(-1.49%)was the worst performer.
* Specifically, the information technology (+2.4%) and consumer discretionary (+1.5%) sectors meaningfully outperformed the broader market, followed by respectable gains in the consumer staples (+0.9%) and real estate (+0.8%) sectors.  
* The S&P 500 had a good shot at closing at a new high today, briefly surpassing its Sept. 2 closing high (3580.84), but the inability to stay above the prior closing high was a technical factor that worked against trading sentiment. 
* Separately, Goldman Sachs remained bullish on equities, forecasting the S&P 500 to hit 4300 by the end of 2021. The call was based on expectations that a COVID-19 vaccine would reopen the economy and a divided government would provide stability and no increase in taxes. 
* The U.S. Treasury market was closed for Veterans Day, leaving the 10-yr yield at 0.98% following yesterday's settlement price. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.3% to 92.99. WTI crude futures increased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $41.49/bbl.

[Original Post](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3u27pp/really_weird_things_are_happening_to_me_22f_not/)  **Nov 24, 2015**

Ok, ok. Ok. I've never ever, ever! Felt the need to post here but I feel like I'm losing my mind?!

I don't even know where to start. My mind is so jumbled. I guess it started two weeks ago at work. I work in a factory, but I don't do the labor, I'm more of a spreadsheet maker/book balancer/secretary type thing. Really informal but it's my uncles company and I needed a job, yadda yadda. Good pay.

I was sitting at my desk with nothing to do, and I hear my boss (not my uncle, just another coworker and a friend of his) go, ""Phil sighs as he looks at the weather.""

I look up like, huh? And he looks at me like, huh? He didn't say anything. I was like...that's weird. But oh well. Anyway.

And then the next day I was talking to some coworkers on the floor asking them work stuff, and one of them called me a bitch but when I called him out, him and everyone else looked at me like I was insane? I apologized and we all laughed it off. Factory is loud, right? People mis-hear things all the time...

Except, I was at Wal-Mart (I know, class) and one of the workers there was putting away stock and I swear to GOD he looked straight at me and said ""The chicken was just killed"" but I asked him what he meant and I felt so bad because he looked so confused and like I was crazy?! He hadn't even opened his mouth apparently. Shit like this has been happening so much, my friend even pulled me aside to ask if I was feeling okay..

Small things are happening too. My boyfriend says he's making salmon for dinner, I hear him preparing salmon, I smell salmon, then he brings it out and it's lasagna. I asked him where the salmon was and he was like, ""...What? I said lasagna tonight"" And brushed it off like I'm being silly.

I could've sworn this one shirt I owned was green and not teal. Shit is changing and people are saying stuff but they're not?! 
People are narrating their lives sometimes?! Theres no way my friends could be pranking me, not when random people on the street are doing this too.
I'm so scared, I don't want to be thrown in a mental hospital. NOT trying to offend mentally ill people, I just. I'm so scared. I feel like my mind is slowly melting...

tl;dr - People keep saying things they aren't actually saying and I think I'm going insane?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**grasmat**

>You should go to the doctor, not just because there might be a physical or mental issue going on that needs to be adressed, but also so you can get an answer of what is going on. Don't keep yourself in limbo, that will drive you insane.

>Doctors aren't your enemy, and even if there's a mental issue going on that doesn't automatically mean you get thrown into a mental hospital just like that. You've probably been around more people with mental disorders than you realise, and the vast majority of them can live a (relatively) normal life and live independently with some medical and/or psychiatric help.

>Go to the doctor, they're the professionals here.

**OOP**

>>Thank you. I'm in Canada, and I made an appointment with my doctor... it'll be a week before I see her though... I can't believe how much this blew up.

>>It happened again last night. Boyfriend said he was going to the bar, I shower and come out and ask why he's still here. ""Because I live here?"" ""I thought you were going to the bar?"" ""No?""

>>Maybe I'll go to the ER if it keeps happening

**cyanpineapple**

>>Not to terrify OP, but this happened to my mother as well, and it was a brain tumor for her. This seriously calls for a doctor as soon as possible.

**rawrvenger**

>>>Yep, sounds pretty similar to a friend. Go get it checked. It's scary. But my friend, she's doing a whole lot better now :)


[Update](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3upcd0/update_really_weird_things_are_happening_to_me/)  **Nov 29, 2015 (5 days later)**

Older post is HERE

Wow. Wowowowow. I never could've ever in my wildest imagination that my last post would get this much attention. I was my on boyfriends reddit account on his phone and actually saw my own post near the first page? I was floored. Then he saw what I was looking at and we had a pretty awkward conversation...

Basically asked me why I posted something like that. He'd read it but only when he saw me on the page it clicked that he saw the same username on my laptop on reddit. He never imagined it was me. (I did change some details about my life in the last post.)

So we talked for a long time and finally he said that he was taking me to emergency. I didn't want to go, I just wanted to wait for my appointment, not because I didn't think it was serious, but because I had no clue how to explain what was happening to the doctors and nurses. Especially for it to warrant an emerg visit.

So we went, and he was very understanding. Just asked me how much I remembered from the past couple days. Stuff he's said, and stuff I'd apparently heard. We were both scared hahaha.

I got to emerg. Very slow. I live in a smallish town but we have a giant hospital for some reason? We're close to a lot of other towns, and they use our hospital. Close to Toronto too. Anyway.

It was slow. Just one father and a sick child. I went in and basically had to explain what was happening and honestly, the nurses were like 'wtf? this bitch is crazy' but when I saw a doctor he took me very very seriously. It was very nice. He wrote down basically everything I said.

I got some xrays and they asked me questions. You know the whole spiel. Anyway the point of this update was to tell you guys that I have a tumor. That's really scary writing out, but I have a tumor. In my brain. It hasn't sunken in yet that tomorrow my brain is going to be under the knife.

I don't want to share more because I've gotten a lot of messages from people who were like... guessing my name. and where im from. apparently i remind people of their friends or crazy exes.

I'm scared to miss work but my boss was more than understanding. He sort of looked at me like I was insane when I asked how long I should be out of work. I don't know. I need to pay rent!!! We'll figure it out.

Thank you all for your love and support. I will update whenever I remember to.
I am scared, but alive.

1k1vyoc,hvacadvice,What are my options with a new R-410A condenser and a 12 year old air handler?,"My condenser unit was struggling so I had it replaced late last year. To avoid needing to replace the air handler unit (which has been doing fine), I went with another R-410A condenser unit. The HVAC tech told me about how the new R-454B systems were coming out, but said I should be fine sticking with R-410A. Now he's saying that I need to replace the AHU ASAP before they run out of stock of the R-410A units. And if I don't replace the AHU this year, then when it goes out, I'll need to replace the condenser as well with an R-454B system. He definitely didn't explain clearly last year that I would need to replace the AHU within a few months, or I would have just replaced the whole system and gotten the federal tax credit. What are my options and what do you recommend? The AHU is 12 years old now, so should I just bite the bullet and replace it?

1k1t0ce,StardewValley,shane lore!!! (repost),"shane grew up with absent parents, who were possibly also addicts. he would go most nights without food, and had bare essentials to care for himself. his relationship with his biological parents is non-existent.

he wanted to be a chicken farm owner, he knew his aunt marnie was a ranch owner, and dreamt to lead a similar path. he got great grades in his agriculture classes, but often flunked everything else. he once had a pet rat, who wasn’t actually domesticated, which he sadly found eating old food from his garbage. he tried to care for it, but it was too hard, so he let it go in the wild. logic says the rat probably did not survive, and that was shane’s first real encounter with grief.

his parents had left him alone for a couple weeks at sixteen, he had no food, and went for a walk to see if he could scavenge anything. he found a family-owned corner store, run by jas’s mother, and contemplated stealing just a couple bottles of water. he attempted to, and was caught by the husband of the business owner, who’s punishment was intervened by jas’s mother, who gave him the water for no cost, and sat him down for food. she told him to return whenever he was hungry, and he did.

he spent so much time around the shop that he began sweeping, and helping stock the shelves after school in exchange for meals. after working there briefly, he began spending nights there, which lead to weekly stays. after a while, he dropped out of high school, quit his gridball team and stayed to help with the store, his parents uninvolved and uncaring toward where he was.

when jas was born, jas’s mother asked shane to be her godfather, he accepted hesitantly. afterwards, her mother and father stretched their money to provide for themselves, jas and shane, which is where he began tendering the shop full time and caring for jas, while jas’s mother became a waitress in a diner out of town to make some extra cash.

jas’s father was often critical, old-fashioned, and believed shane to be a risk. he got in contact with marnie through an emergency contact in the school system, and asked for assistance. marnie wrote her address down and mailed it to him. he never acted upon the response because he slowly grew to trust shane, even if shane was unaware of this. i think there was tension between shane and the father, not out of malice or intentional anger, but just the dynamic they shared. shane, a somewhat morally defiant, stubborn, independent young boy who only wants to have use in the world, and jas’s father, an ‘old money’ businessman with more stereotypical approach to raising children and housework. i think shane might have resented the father a little bit, because unknowingly, he kind of endorsed a house-maid/wife routine onto jas’s mother, who was evidently more eccentric and somewhat different to most.

one night, when the couple finally had their first weekend off in months, shane suggested for them to go out on a date while he would care for jas. ‘just don’t break too many bones’, he said, ‘we aren’t that old, shane. we can still dance!’ they reply, out the door with unknowing laughter. on the way home, they got in a car accident, a collision with a truck driver. they did not make it home.

he spent the night in silent agony, but not acting on worry in order to keep jas sated. but deep down, he knew that she understood something was wrong. the way she mumbled, reaching out for hands that were not there to hold her. the next morning, police arrive at the door, informing him of the news. jas asleep in the next room, while he’s on the other side of the wall holding in tears like a coward. they question him, and he palms their questions off as if he were jas’s uncle, supposed to be staying to care for her while her parents were working.

he did not attend the funeral, out of fear that maybe a family member would question his relation to jas and try to take her, but also because he simply could not afford to. he had no car, scrapping together coins, and working night shifts just to feed jas.

once when she was in her younger years, maybe three or four, while struggling with her emotional regulation, she was yelling and crying in the living room of her mother and fathers house. she kept asking shane to bring her to them, to let her see them, and it made shane feel like a monster keeping her captive.

he then tries to work the shop in order to pay for bills, rent, jas’s formula, keeping his needs last priority. he works himself thin. one evening, he was searching through documents in jas’s father’s drawer, trying to find information to transfer the money from his pocket to their former bank account. he finds a letter, with a large, bubbly ‘m’ on the envelope. he opens it, and reads the contents.

aunt marnie, who offered him a place to stay multiple times throughout childhood, reached out to him, two years from the current date. he is eighteen, scared and emotionally fragile, trying to care blindly for a child while working like nothing else. a couple days before jas’s third birthday, he saves up enough money to buy a ticket to catch a train with jas down to stardew valley.

he packs their belongings and says goodbye to his former home, the one that nurtured him when nights were cold. it wasn’t perfect, but it was home. he pockets a polaroid of the family, his family, his little smile absolutely glowing. they made it to stardew valley, where marnie adopted jas legally into her care, and adopted shane into the home. he regained his love for chickens, caring for his coop of chickens in private. but despite the goodness that followed, he felt immense amounts of guilt. he would always seek out some sort of warmth, like the meals jas’s mother used to prepare for him, or the bottle of water that changed everything. but instead of water, he turned to the burn of beer.

he was disappointed in himself, and perpetuated his guilt by turning to the very same addiction that took his parents away.

and heres some context to how i view jas’s parents. jas’s mother is an eccentric, quirky woman, loud and passionate and driven by kindness. she has odd views, ones that jas’s father don’t share. she loves dancing to music and she almost became a motherly figure to shane, teaching him how to ride bikes, how to swim and how to wash his hair. jas’s father on the other end, is a stern businessman, firm in his views, and shows even a sense of outdated, toxic masculinity. he believes in gender roles, women in the kitchen and men working. thats why is is so conflicted by shane, who is initially weak in hindsight, malnourished and blunt. shane is exactly what he doesn’t want, straightforward, stubborn, and a little foul mouthed. but jas’s father doesn’t hate shane, he just feels threatened by him. jas’s fathers need to protect his family ‘like a man would’ shines through his actions. he’s not entirely negative toward shane, hes distant, cold. but he eventually grows to trust shane, watching how he takes care of jas and is almost envious of how easy shane’s paternal instincts shine through. this is why he doesn’t act on the letter from marnie, because as much as he may fear or even resent shane, he needs shane to live structurally.",shane lore repost,shane grew absent parents possibly also addicts would go nights without food bare essentials care relationship biological

Episode 2: Not So Happy Campers - Part 2

""Last time, on Total Drama Island! Twenty-two campers have signed up to spend eight weeks right here at this crummy old summer camp, then have to face the judgment of their fellow campers.""

""This is our first challenge, how hard can it be?"" The clip of Rodney eating with his team was shown, followed by a switch to the cliff.

""Oh, (BLEEP)!""

(Theme Song)

[Several shots of the lights and cameras hidden around camp popping out and turning on, often at the expense of the wildlife. A cue card marks a transition to a fly-by shot starting at the docks and 'Wawanakwa' sign, past the camp facilities, and over the top of the host drinking coffee in a director's chair just as the lyrics start.]

Dear Mom and Dad, I'm doing fine;

[The camera flies through the trees and up to the largest cliff, peeking over to see two rings of buoys laid out in the water.]

You guys are on my mind!

[The camera dives off the cliff and into an underwater shot; Owen swims through the water in his swimsuit and farts. The gas blows behind him and kills a fish.]

You asked me what I wanted to be,

And now I think the answer is plain to see!

[A cut to the surface, where Brick and Dawn are sitting on a surfboard and looking at each other. The fish surfaces, allowing for an eagle to come pick it up.]

I wanna be...famous!

[The eagle and fish hang in front of the sun for a moment before the eagle drops the fish into the woods. The camera pans down to Rodney sitting on a stump and looking at pictures admiringly; the fish hits him in the head, knocking him over. The camera zooms out to show Duncan watching the scene and laughing, and then again to show Courtney upset with Duncan.]

I wanna live close to the sun!

[The camera zooms to another part of camp, showing Heather and Jo fighting in a canoe and don't notice the waterfall until they fall over the edge.]

Well pack your bags, 'cause I've already won!

[The shot pans down to the bottom of the waterfall, showing Harold standing on a broken log suspended between two rocks. He is seen practicing martial arts moves while Heather and Jo fall behind him. Shawn, feeling panicked, comes into view by swinging on a vine and collides with Harold, sending both flying off to the left of the camera.]

Everything to prove, nothing in my way;

[The camera rapidly pans to follow Harold and Shawn, and they eventually slam into the outhouse confessional. The impact causes Lindsay to fly out the door, and the camera pans over to the Main Lodge – Chef's silhouette is visible in the window.]

I'll get there one day.

[The camera moves in past the window to show a smirking Chef, arm deep in a large pot of something sickly green. He looks behind him to where Ezekiel and Noah are sitting, both tied up. The two share a nervous glance.]

'Cause I wanna be...famous!

[The camera pans left to show Eva and Sky arm wrestling until Eva beats Sky. The camera zooms out past another window to show the edge of the docks. Katie and Sadie are sitting and admiring someone off-camera.]

(Na-na nanananaa, nanana-nanaa, na-nananananaa)

[A pan down the docks shows Lightning flexing and kissing both of his muscles. The camera pans right to show a seagull, with a fragment of net wrapped around its neck, sitting on the water as a shark jumps over it and eats a trout in mid-air. The seagull appears to be safe until a mysterious tentacle grabs it, and pulls it under the water.]

I wanna be! I wanna be! I wanna be famous! (Na-na nanananaa, nanana-nanaa, na-nananananaa)

I wanna be! I wanna be! I wanna be famous! (Na-na nanananaa, nanana-nanaa, na-nananananaa)

[The camera moves to Beth waving at the camera and taking some steps back. She twirls a flaming baton while passing it back and forth between her hands, then tosses it in the air. The camera follows the baton as day turns into night. The scene pans down to reveal Ella and Mike sitting at a campfire in front of a large full moon. They lean in for a kiss but are interrupted by Cody's sudden appearance between them, an arm around both of them and an goofy smile. The shot zooms out to show the other campers also sitting around the fire and whistling the last few notes of the theme song as Chris watches.]

The episode resumes with the campers on the cliff. ""Okay!"" Chris said next to a crate. ""Today's challenge is threefold! Your first task is to jump off this one-thousand-foot high cliff, into the lake.""

""Easy enough,"" Jo said with a smirk.

""If you look down, you will see two target areas,"" Chris continued. ""The wider area represents the part of the lake that we have stocked with psychotic,"" he laughed as a shark jumped out of the water, ""man-eating sharks! Inside that area is a safe zone. That's your target area, which we're pretty sure is shark-free!""

""Shark-free?"" Shawn asked.

""For each member of your team that jumps and actually...survives, there will be a crate of supplies waiting below,"" Chris presented the two stacks of crates on the beach. ""Inside each crate are supplies that you'll need for the second part of the challenge...building a hot tub!

""The team with the best one gets to have a wicked hot tub party tonight!"" the host continued. ""The losers will be sending someone home. Let's see… Killer Bass! You're up first!""

Shawn looked down at the water. ""Oh man, that's a long drop! So, uh, who wants to go first?”

As expected, nobody volunteered and just stayed still.

""Hey, don't sweat it guys!"" Owen said. ""I heard that these shows always make the interns do the stunt first, to make sure it's survivable.""

The footage cut to Chris and Chef at the top of the cliff, the latter wearing his swimsuit. ""We need to test the stunts first!"" Chris exclaimed. ""You know that!""

""Do I look like an intern?"" Chef asked.

""No,"" Chris replied, ""but the ones we had are all in the hospital. Come on. Just jump it, you big chicken!"" He made a few clucking noises.

""I don't get paid enough for this man,"" Chef said, snapping his swim goggles over his eyes. He jumped off the cliff and screamed all the way down.

Chef landed in the water and surfaced. ""Hey! I made it!"" he said. ""I made it man!"" He then felt something underwater. ""Something just brushed by my foot!"" he looked around while a shark fin swam behind. ""Hey Chris, man! Somethin' ain't right down here!""

He sank below the water before jumping out of it, screaming and running away from the shark.

Chris wrote something on a clipboard. ""Well! That seems safe enough,"" he concluded and walked away.

The footage was back to the present. ""So, who’s up?” Eva asked her teammates.

""Ladies first,"" Duncan told the muscle woman.

""I'll jump,"" Shawn stepped up. ""All we have to do is time it right and make it to the safe zone.""

He jumped off the cliff and landed in the inner circle. He surfaced and smiled at his team while a boat came to pick him up.

Mike was shown gulping as he looked down. ""Okay Mike. It's just an insane cliff dive into shark infested waters. You can do this, c'mon.""

He then suddenly inhaled. ""Wrong! Only vone person can do dis!” he declared in a fairly good Russian accent, his voice taking on a feminine aspect to accompany what almost looked like fuller lips and longer eyelashes as he began tiptoeing forward. “Svetlana, ze Olympic queen of gymnastics!”

Svetlana then did a backflip before landing in the safe zone. Afterwards, Svetlana inhaled into Mike, who was looking confused. ""How did I get here?""

Confessional: Mike

""Okay, okay. I admit it. I... I have Dissociative Identity Disorder,"" Mike told the confessional camera. ""I try to control them, but they never listen to me. I auditioned for this show to prove I'm more than just my disorder. I don't know how I'm going to tell my teammates.""

Confessional Ends

A series of campers jumping started. Ella came first, cheering the whole way down. Eva followed shortly, screaming ""Look out below!"" Duncan was next, silently falling with his arms crossed.

Back at the clifftop, Rodney was next in line but looked worried. ""I'm not jumping,"" he said.

""Why not?"" Chris asked.

""That water is filled with sharks,"" Rodney said. ""I don't do well around them, and one of my uncles died because of a shark.""

""That's okay, man,"" Chris seemingly comforted him. ""Unfortunately, that also makes you a chicken."" He placed a chicken hat on top of the country boy's head. ""So, you'll have to wear this for the rest of the day.""

""It's just a hat,"" Rodney said. ""I can handle it.""

Chris made chicken noises in order to tease Rodney. ""That means the chicken's path down is that-a-way,"" he showed an escalator somehow attached to the cliff, and Rodney walked down on it. ""Next?”

""YEE-HAW!"" Ezekiel cheered and jumped off, hitting a protruding rock halfway down which sent him spinning yet landing perfectly in the center ring. The scene cut to his teammates cheering on the beach, then him giving a thumbs up in response.

""Yes!"" Harold called out before his jump. He yelled in glee the whole trip down before he groaned in pain. Birds flew away, and various campers and even the sharks cringed as the dweeb sank into the water holding his groin.

""Oh, hate to see that happen,"" Chris said from the top of the cliff, Courtney right next to him.

""Excuse me Chris, I have a medical condition,"" Courtney said.

""What condition?"" Chris asked.

""A condition that prevents me from jumping off cliffs,"" Courtney said.

“You can chicken out if you want, but it might end up costing your team the win... and then they'll hate you,” Chris reminded.

“It's a calculated risk. I've seen the other team, and I don't think nine of them will jump,” Courtney assumed while looking at the Gophers.

“Alright, here is your chicken hat,” Chris placed the hat on Courtney's head.

Chris then held up a clipboard and checked the progress. ""So, let's tally up the results. Hold on, that's seven jumpers and two chickens. We're missing two.""

Sadie and Katie were holding each other's hand while Dawn watched them. ""I'm not jumping without Katie!"" Sadie declared.

""We have to be on the same team, Chris!"" Katie begged. ""Please!""

Katie and Sadie stood in front of Chris and began to plead over and over. ""Please! Can we? Can we, can we, Chris? Can we, can we, can we?!""

""I'll switch places with her,"" Dawn spoke up.

""Alright, fine!"" Chris said in exasperation. ""You're both on the Killer Bass now. Dawn, you're on the Screaming Gophers.""

""Yes!"" The BFFFLs cheered and Dawn went over to her new team.

""That means you're up, girls!"" Chris told Katie and Sadie.

Katie and Sadie held each other's hand and ran down the cliff. ""We're coming, Killer Bass!"" They shouted to the team and jumped into the safe zone.

Chris observed the score. ""Okay. So that's nine jumpers and two chickens."" He turned around to look at the other team. ""Screaming Gophers! If you can beat that, we'll throw in a pull cart to put your crates on!""

""Great,"" Brick focused on his team. ""So, who's up first?”

The Gophers were silent until Heather broke the silence. “I'm sorry. There is no way I'm doing this.”

""Why not?"" Beth asked.

""Hello, national TV?"" Heather replied. ""I'll get my hair wet.""

""You gotta be kidding, right?"" Jo asked in disbelief.

“If she's not doing it, I'm not doing it,” Lindsay spoke up, and the two girls smiled at each other.

Jo stepped up to Heather. ""You're jumping, Queenie!"" she fiercely told the queen bee. “No way are we losing because of your hair day!”

""Make me!"" Heather dared Jo, prompting the jock-ette to pick her up and throw her off the cliff. She screamed all the way down, successfully landing in the target zone. As she resurfaced, she looked up threateningly. ""Jo, you are so dead!""

""Tell me something I don't hear everyday!"" Jo yelled back. ""Now I just have to hit the safe zone as well.""

Jo jumped, screaming all the way down, and landed in the safe zone next to an angry Heather.

""I thought this was going to be a talent contest,"" Lindsay told Chris fearfully.

Chris laughed. ""Yeah, no!""

Once again, a series of jumping contestants started to play. Lindsay was screaming her lungs out, Sky was also yelping as well, Cody was hollering, Lightning was in a cannonball position doing a front flip, and Noah fell quietly and with a bored expression.

Dawn dived into the water next, but she missed the safe zone. The sharks swam towards her, and her teammates warned her to get away.

""Oh, um, yes, I don't suppose you'd like to help me get to shore?"" Dawn asked the sharks, backing away in fear. The three fish actually stopped to look at each other for a moment before resuming their approach. ""Right, yes, just checking!"" Dawn said, hurrying to the 'safe' area and the waiting ship.

Meanwhile, Beth was looking down at the water. ""I... I can't do it. I'm too scared."" Chris pulls out another chicken hat. ""I'm sorry!""

On the boat, Cody and Lightning were making chicken noises at Beth's failure.

""That is like, so lame, right?"" Lindsay looked back at Heather.

""Fully lame!"" Heather responded.

""Let's do this!"" Brick told Owen and jumped off the cliff, perfectly landing in the safe zone.

Chris held up a megaphone. ""Okay, campers! There's only one person left!"" he talked about Owen. ""You guys need this jump for the win!"" He turned to Owen and said ""No pressure, dude!"" Owen smiled confidently until the host added ""Okay, there's pressure!""

Down below, the Screaming Gophers were encouraging and giving Owen support to jump into the water. ""Just do it Owen! Do it!"" Heather shouted.

Confessional: Owen

""Oh, I was pretty darn nervous,"" Owen confessed. ""See the thing is, I'm not that strong a swimmer.""

Confessional: Shawn

""Yeah, I don't think he's gonna jump,"" Shawn said point blank.

Confessional: Jo

""If he goes through with this, he's probably dead,"" Jo guessed.

Confessionals End

The camera cut back to Chris and Owen at the clifftop. ""Take a good run at it buddy,"" Chris coached. ""You can do this!""

Owen walked away from the camera. ""I'm going to die now. I'm going to freaking die now,"" he lamented. The other nine members of the Screaming Gophers who'd already jumped were shown on the beach, looking up at Owen in anticipation and fear. Owen's fist was shown being clenched, before a few members of the Killer Bass were shown in profile, looking up as well.

A shot of Owen's eyes narrowing, then back to Brick on the beach. ""You've got this, soldier!"" he called up to his teammate.

Owen charged past Chris and straight off the cliff, the tone of his screams changing rapidly from determination to utter fear as he yelled “OH CRAP!” Various angles of his fall were shown, and he finally belly flopped into the water, creating a huge splash that wiped everybody out, including the sharks.

Moments later, Owen resurfaced. ""Yes! Yeah! Oh yeah, who's the man?"" he whooped over his teammate's cheers.

Back at the clifftop, Chris made use of his megaphone once more. ""The winners! The Screaming Gophers!""

""Well done, Owen,"" Brick complimented him until he noticed the big guy looking around. ""What's wrong?""

""I, uh, think I lost my bathing suit,"" Owen admitted, and he received a lot of disgusted remarks from the campers.

(Commercial Break)

The Gophers were carrying their crates in carts back to the cabins and singing '99 Bottles of Pop'.

""Forty-nine bottles of pop on the wall, forty-nine bottles of pop! If one of those bottles should happen to fall, forty-eight bottles of pop on the wall!""

The Bass, on the other hand, were struggling with their crates. They had to carry, push, or kick the crates to the campgrounds.

Courtney was pushing her crate until she stopped suddenly. ""I think I just got a splinter!"" the control freak inspected her hand in a bothered manner.

Eva came over and lifted Courtney's crate. ""Shut up and pick up your crate!"" She dropped the crate in front of her. ""Chicken!""

""Hey! I'm the only one with CIT camping experience here!"" Courtney said back. ""You need me!""

Her statement caused Eva and Shawn to look at each other in disbelief.

The camera quick-panned back to the other team. As they sang past the thirty-second bottle, Lindsay found a conch shell on the ground. After picking it up and inspecting it, she left it on the ground and ran to catch up with the other Gophers.

Over on the Bass, Shawn dropped the crate he was carrying. ""I have to go pee,"" he informed his team.

""Hurry up,"" Eva said to Shawn. ""We're already behind.""

""Oh, I have to go too,"" Katie said while she and her friend were pushing a crate together.

""You do? Oh my gosh, me too!"" Sadie responded and they stopped pushing and followed Shawn. However, they decided to go a different direction than him.

A fly flew around Courtney's face, causing the girl to smack it at her right eye. As a result, it became swollen. ""I think something just bit me!"" she complained.

The scene cut back to the Gophers. ""...should happen to fall, twenty-eight bottles of pop on the wall!""

The team came to a stop. ""Hey look!"" Beth said as she looked at the cabins. ""There's the campgrounds!""

""That was pretty easy!"" Owen bragged.

""I'm pleasantly surprised!"" Cody added.

Meanwhile, Eva saw Sadie and Katie coming their way. ""All better?"" she asked.

""Yep!"" Katie answered.

""Can we go now? I think my eye is swelling up,"" Courtney said as the BFFFLs pushed a crate in front of her, their butts starting to turn red.

""Ooh, something's itching me,"" Sadie whined. ""Are you itchy too?""

Katie looked at Sadie. ""Totally itchy. Really bad.”

The camera cut to Chris walking past Brick, Noah, and Sky as they worked to open a pair of crates by using their teeth. ""Remember, you guys can only use your teeth to open the crates!"" the host said. ""I came up with that one!""

Brick was focused on as he pulled on the rope. ""I think I got it open!"" He yanked the rope, and the crate opened to show materials. ""Rope burn on my tongue!"" he winced in pain.

The footage changed back to Katie and Sadie noticing their burning butts turning more red. ""Ooh, it's really itching now,"" the latter said.

""Mine feels like it's burning,"" Katie replied.

""Okay, I have to scratch!"" Sadie declared, causing the two girls to stop pushing and start scratching their butts.

Chris was pulling up on his red ATV. ""You guys are way behind the other team,"" Chris criticized them. ""Like, way behind. What's the problem?""

""Their butts are itchy!"" Courtney answered.

Chris caught a glimpse of Courtney's swollen eye and winced. ""Ooh, that's bad!""

""Did you girls squat down when you peed in the woods?"" Rodney started to question the itchy girls.

""Yeah,"" Katie replied.

""Did you notice what kind of plants you were squatting over?"" Rodney continued.

""They were kind of oval-shaped and green and all over the place,"" Sadie answered.

""Were they low to the ground? About this big?"" Rodney physically described the plant, and the girls nodded. ""You two squatted on poison ivy.""

After hearing those words, Katie and Sadie stopped scratching their butts and began to panic.

""No way. That's awesome!"" Chris chuckled at their pain.

""Somebody help us!"" Katie shouted as she and Sadie were rubbing their butts against the sand.

Back at the campgrounds, the Gophers had managed to open a few of their crates and were now looking through their contents.

Owen pulled out two pairs of wood. ""Hey, check it out! I got wood!""

Brick took out a hammer and a pool liner. ""I've got some tools here, and what looks like a pool liner.”

Jo was also looking for tools until Heather and Lindsay went up to her. ""I just wanted to say,"" the queen bee said, ""I didn't mean all those insults about you before. And I love your hoodie. It's so bold.""

""I know a fake apology when I see one,"" Jo replied, unconvinced. ""Just contribute more to the team other than looking pretty and I won't think about voting you off first.""

""I completely understand you throwing me off the cliff. I needed a push,"" Heather said and she and Lindsay walked off.

""You didn't mean all that stuff you said to Jolene back there?"" Lindsay wondered.

""Jo?"" Heather corrected. ""Of course I didn't mean it. She's going down. And P.S.? That is the ugliest hoodie I've seen in my life.""

""Ohh,"" Lindsay said, still rather confused while Heather applied lip gloss onto her lips. ""So if you hate her, why were you being nice to her?""

""You ever seen one of these shows before? Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,"" Heather explained.

""Ohhhhh..."" Lindsay understood. ""I'm your friend, right?""

""Oh yeah. For now,"" Heather answered uncaringly and walked off.

Brick, Noah, and Sky were standing near their crate until they saw the Killer Bass, particularly Harold, Ezekiel, and Courtney, arriving with crates on their hands.

""Finally!"" Harold panted.

""Hello, Bass,"" Brick greeted the team.

Jo rose up from the crate. ""What happened to the Screeching Twins?"" Her question caused the Bass to look around.

Sadie and Katie had their shorts pulled down and were soaking their butts on the ocean in order to get rid of the rashes.

""They're getting a drink,"" Courtney answered.

""Yeah, if they drink with their butts,"" Harold whispered to Ezekiel.

""That's funny,"" Ezekiel laughed.

Brick took notice of Courtney's eye and yelped. ""What happened to your eye?""

""Nothing. Just an allergy,"" Courtney claimed.

""Think it's getting worse,"" Ezekiel noted.

""Shut up!"" Courtney shushed. ""We don't want them to know that!""

The scene cut to Shawn standing on top of a few crates. ""Guys, it's not too late for us to still win!"" he tried to coach his team, but his speech didn't inspire the team, and they were all looking bored and unwilling to do anything.

Ezekiel was shown to be picking his nose, causing Courtney to complain with an “Ew!”

""What?"" Ezekiel wiped the snot on his pants.

""That's really gross,” Mike flinched.

""Okay, look guys,"" Courtney stood up and got everyone's attention. ""We have a hot tub to complete, and we need a project manager. Since I've actually been a CIT before, I'm electing myself. Any objections?""

""Where do we begin, Cyclops?"" Duncan mocked, making everyone gasp.

""Open the crates!"" Courtney glared at him. ""Mike, go find those itchy girls. We need all the help we can get.""

For the Gophers, Lightning and Beth were hammering in the nails. For the Bass, Harold and Shawn were stacking the wood together, but due to the instability, the pool fell apart.

Heather handed Brick a hammer to plug a nail into the pool. Duncan and Mike were fighting over who gets the hammer. It fell out of their hands, and it landed on Harold's crotch. Ella picked up a board and unintentionally hit Harold in the head with it multiple times.

The Gophers had formed a bucket brigade between the lake and their tub. From Noah to Cody to Lightning to Sky, the water was poured into the pool. The Bass, on the other hand, were shown fixing a leak that appeared by putting duct tape on the hole courtesy of Courtney.

The scene cut to both teams standing by their hot tubs with Chris looking at them.

Chris looked at the Screaming Gophers'. ""This is an awesome hot tub!"" he exclaimed, and the Gophers cheered.

""Nice!"" Owen said, popping out of the tub with a splash.

Chris approached the Bass, who gasped as Chris was squirted by a leak. Eventually, the tub couldn't hold and it got disassembled.

""Well, I think we have a winner here!"" Chris decided. ""The Screaming Gophers!""

The Gophers cheered and the Bass looked glum. ""Gophers!"" Chris told the winning team, ""you're safe from elimination and you get to rock this awesome hot tub for the rest of the summer! Bonus!""

The Gophers cheered again.

""Killer Bass!"" Chris turned his head to them. ""What can I say? Sucks to be you right now! I'll see your sorry butts at the bonfire tonight.""

""We won! We all get to stay here for another three days!"" Lindsay cheered alongside Beth and Heather.

They were cut short by Owen, who was cheering as well, but was butt-naked with his groin being pixelated. “Yes! We get to stay-ay! We get to stay-ay! We are so awesome! We won the contest!” He rushed up to hug the three, who were feeling disturbed.

The camera cut to the Mess Hall. The Gophers were eating while the Bass were in the middle of a discussion.

""So, uh, what do we do now?"" Katie asked from her seat.

""We have to figure out who we're gonna vote off,"" Courtney replied.

""Well I think it should be Princess or the Country Boy here,"" Duncan listed out Courtney and Rodney.

""What? Why?"" Courtney questioned him.

""Because, unless I'm mistaken, you two are the only ones here wearing chicken hats. And if we ever have to lift a truck, I like our odds with the big guy,"" Duncan smiled at Rodney, who was happy as well.

""But you guys need me,” Courtney protested. “I'm the only one-""

Mike suddenly inhaled deeply and as he let the breath out, he closed one eye, curled his lips inward and put a hand on his lower back. ""Enough already with your hankering about being a CIT!"" he exclaimed in a grumpier, elderly-sounding voice.

""Uh, Mike, are you okay?” Ezekiel asked.

“Mike? Name's Chester, mister,” the old man introduced himself and focused on Courtney. “And who would you wanna blame for today's loss?”

""What about… you?"" Courtney pointed to Chester.

""Hey, at least he jumped off the cliff, chicken wing,"" Duncan said.

""Shut up!"" Courtney got into Duncan's face.

Shawn got in-between them. ""Okay, we should chill out before we all lose our minds, and the zombies should be taking them.""

""I've had enough prison food for one day. I'm gonna go have a nap,"" Duncan got up and walked off.

""You can't do that! We haven't decided who's going yet!"" Courtney called.

“I think we already have,” Eva said as she and the others also walked off, leaving Courtney by herself to groan.

The scene cuts to the Killer Bass at the elimination ceremony.

""Killer Bass,"" Chris said while holding a plate of marshmallows. ""At camp, marshmallows represent a tasty treat that you enjoy roasting by the fire. At this camp, marshmallows represent life.""

Mike was feeling anxious, but turned to smile at Ella, who also smiled as well.

""You've all cast your votes,"" Chris continued, ""and made your decision. There are only ten marshmallows on this plate! When I call your name, come up and claim your marshmallow. The camper who does not receive a marshmallow tonight must immediately return to the Dock of Shame to catch the Boat of Losers. That means, you're out of the contest. And you can't come back. Ever.""

""The first marshmallow goes to...Ezekiel!"" The homeschooler smiled, and approached the host to get a marshmallow put on the stick he held.

""Shawn!""

""Sweet!"" Shawn gleamed and went to get his treat.

""Katie!""

""Ella!""

""Rodney!""

""Harold!""

“Yes!” Harold celebrated and got off his stump.

""Sadie!""

""Oh yay!"" Sadie gained her marshmallow and hugged Katie. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you!”

""Eva!""

""Duncan!""

Courtney and Mike were left.

""Campers,"" Chris said, ""this is the final marshmallow of the evening!""

The bottom two looked nervously at each other and waited for Chris to announce the last person safe.

…

…

…

…

""Mike.""

As Courtney felt sad, Mike ran up to get his stick that Chris put a marshmallow on.

""Can't say I'm shocked,"" Chris said. ""You didn't come through for your team."" He made his way over to Courtney. ""Dock of Shame is that way!""

Courtney started walking, and the footage skipped ahead to her walking the Dock of Shame alone.

""The rest of you!"" Chris addressed the remaining Bass. ""Enjoy your marshmallows! You're all safe. For tonight.""

Courtney was shown at the end of the dock as the Boat of Losers, driven by Chef, arrived.

Confessional: Ezekiel

""I really don't understand how we lost the challenge eh,"" Ezekiel confessed. “I was going to bring it up earlier, but Mike's acting made me lose my train of thought.”

Confessional Ends

The scene cut to the Gophers partying. Brick, Lindsay, Cody, Heather, and Lightning were all enjoying the hot tub, and Cody raised a glass to toast. ""To the Screaming Gophers!"" The four in the tub with him repeated the toast, and they all cheered. Those that weren't in the tub also cheered.

""Go Gophers! Go Gophers!"" Owen began to dance in front of the tub. Noah and Sky joined in, the three chanting ""Go Gophers!"" over and and over again.

Confessional: Jo

""My team won the first challenge of the season, and I'm all for winning,"" Jo said ominously, ""but a real competitor knows it isn't over until there's only one left standing. And that's gonna be me,"" she snarled dangerously.

As you may know, Powell sat down and had a long discussion about the markets. No new interest rate announcements came out of it, and the general takeaway is that he's adopting a cautionary approach due to the general policy uncertainty.

Today, the President threatened to fire Powell in a Truth Social message. The wording strongly implies that he's waiting for permission from the courts, although he did not directly state this.

What are your thoughts?

To me, a FED chair replacement offers both extreme risk and possible opportunity.

I'm going to set aside the question of whether the President has the right to fire the head of an independent agency as this is a political question.

In my view, Powell achieved the near impossible. He managed to soft-land the global economy following the Covid panic and its inflationary spending fallout. A measured policy of rate cuts came as the economy improved. We had a reasonably predictable environment of stock and crypto earnings. I think there is general market consensus that he did a good job.

If he's removed, he'll likely be replaced with a Trump loyalist and possibly an ideologue. We've seen that most of Trump's picks fall into one or both of these categories. Trump has repeatedly stated he wants aggressive rate cuts, and will likely get them if the chairman is no longer an independent agency head.

I'm no economist, but I see this going one of two ways that matters for Hege.

First, the termination of the independence of the Federal Reserve may shake the faith of treasury bond investors in the US dollar. Trump is signaling a desire to aggressively lower the value of the US dollar to make exports more attractive. He's also signalled a willingness to lower the value of the dollar in order to force investors to refinance the debt at a lower rate.

People buy treasury bonds not for their high returns, but because they are seen as safe investments. If they are reevaluated as risky assets, yields will soar. This may cause investors to ditch US government debt for gold, international corporate bonds, international stocks, and *crypto*.

We might see a rise in BTC; but BTC tends to move as a tech stock. Upward movement may be dampened by an overall worsening macro environment. It's unclear to me if this will also cause a run on SOL-based assets. We've seen BTC dominate recently.

Moreover, there is a chance a new chairman might be bullish for crypto, and by extension Hege. If a new chairman aggressively cut interest rates, we'll likely see a sharp rise in global liquidity. This tends to send the stock and crypto markets into a major rally. It's a very reliable relationship that played out as recently as 2020-2021. Of course, cheap money in the wrong economy might lead to a major bout of inflation. The markets may bubble and experience a hard correction.

1k1mzby,fantasybooking,Rebooking WrestleMania 33,"WrestleMania 33 Preshow

1. Neville (c) vs Austin Aries (Cruiserweight Title): I will keep this match as these were the top two cruiserweights at the time, and put on an underrated match. Some people may have chosen Aries to win, but with him leaving a few months after this, I'd keep the belt on Neville and continue his dominant reign as King of the Cruiserweights. 
2. Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royale: I also thought the winner of the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royale should have gotten a World title match, which I will add to this match. With that in mind, I focus on that being the goal for all of the men in the match, with the final 2 being two credible threats. The final two of the match would be Sami Zayn and Samoa Joe, and I'd have them have a mini-match going back and forth. Sami would try to eliminate Samoa Joe on the apron, but he would put Sami in the Coquina Clutch on the apron. Samoa Joe would knock out Sami Zayn and celebrate in the ring as a top monster going forward. (Sidenote: To fill up this match since there are a few multi-men matches later in the card, I'd just add more 205 LIVE and NXT wrestlers to the mix.) 
3. The Miz (c) vs Dolph Ziggler vs Baron Corbin vs Kalisto vs Apollo Crews vs Mojo Rawley vs Tye Dillinger (NXT) vs TJ Perkins (205 Live) (Men's SmackDown Land of Opportunity 8-Pack Challenge IC Title): Because of the reshuffling of the card, I unfortunately didn't have a proper match for the Miz. I considered doing Miz vs Ziggler again, but since they did that the whole year, I wasn't sure if that feud had been played out at that point, so I instead wanted to play off the theme that SmackDown was the Land of Opportunity at the time. I thought that since there was a multiperson match for the ladies, I would give one for the men for their IC title. SmackDown had a much smaller roster at the time, so I also decided to add a representative of 205 Live and NXT to show that this show will give opportunities to any wrestler. So with that, I added TJ Perkins because he had a very great 2016 being the first Cruiserweight champion of the revived 205 Live, while Tye Dillinger was going to be called up to SmackDown shortly after Mania 33. I'd have this match just be fast-paced with a lot of spots. You can have guys like Perkins, Kalisto, and Crews fly all over the place, and possibly have a spot where Gronk could take the Miz. At the end of the match, I'd have Ziggler about to hit Dillinger with a superkick, but its ducked. Dillinger rolls up Ziggler for the massive upset, becoming the new IC champion. Tye Dillinger was at his most popular at this point, and giving him the shocking win would have done wonders for him on the Main Roster. His call-up became pointless, so giving him a strong start could have helped him during his time starting up on SmackDown. This could also set up the Miz feeling he has a conspiracy against him, building up his stock as a main eventer. This would set up guys from the match wanting singles chances for the IC title, such as Miz, Corbin, and Ziggler. In the end, it's a feel-good moment before the main show starts. 

WrestleMania 33 Main Show

1. Dean Ambrose vs Shane McMahon: Having this match instead of the original matches between AJ/McMahon and Ambrose/Corbin gives both men more important matches on the main card, while telling a more compelling story. In this version, I'd set this up so that Ambrose feels that he was so close time and time again at regaining the WWE title, but he would come short. He would get one more chance facing AJ Styles the SmackDown at the Elimination Chamber match, where he'd face Styles in the final two. He'd take out James Ellsworth before the match so there was no distraction, but in the end, he'd lose. Ambrose would throw a fit and would get security guards trying to get him to calm down. Shane would come down to try to stop him, but Ambrose would hit him with a Dirty Deeds. Even though he's attacking the baby face Shane, I'd slowly have Ambrose dip his toe in being a heel, but I fully won't turn him until he gets drafted to Raw. Shane McMahon wants to get revenge for Ambrose hurting him, leading to their singles match. I think that it would be a great match between the SmackDown Commissioner vs their #1 draft pick, with Ambrose getting the win. This would set him up wanting to leave SmackDown heading, heading to Raw, and having unfinished business.
2. Bray Wyatt vs Randy Orton vs Luke Harper: While I loved the fact that Bray Wyatt was able to say that he was a WWE champion, the story around it here wasn't necessary for him to win, and the way it affected Bray's career hurt him afterwards. So instead of Bray vs Orton in the badly booked ""projection match,"" have this be a triple-threat Wyatt Family implosion. Luke Harper got extremely popular at this time and had a lot of fan sympathy. In this match, I'd have Bray act as the main heel, Orton being the treacherous babyface, while being in the Middle, but still have feelings of loyalty to Bray. There would be a moment where all three would have a moment being forced to work together, taking out the other guy. At the end of the match, Orton would hit an RKO on Orton and Harper, which would to the lights to go out. The lights would come back on, and Erick Rowan would make his return, hitting Orton with a chokeslam. Rowan would look at both Bray and Harper debating to see who he'd help out. In the end, he'd drag Harper onto Orton, choosing his brother to win this match. The crowd would be shocked by this decision as Erick Rowan would lift the arm of Harper. Bray would look at Rowan, betrayed, and Rowan would decide to form the Blugion Brothers here. Heading into Backlash, this would lead to the wild story of Orton and Bray having to work together to fight Rowan and Harper, who both want revenge from each man. They would want revenge on Orton for destroying the family and betraying Bray, but not forgive Bray for accepting an outsider, choosing to side with a snake over a brother. 
3. Roman Reigns (c) vs Braun Strowman (US Title): The Undertaker vs Reigns was a really sad match to watch, seeing Undertaker not in ring shape. It was a sad match, but I feel it could have been removed and replaced with Reigns still being the US champion. In this version, Roman Reigns would have never lost the US title to Chris Jericho, and would have stayed as the champion heading into Mania. He'd have to face his toughest challenge yet, facing Braun Strowman at Mania. This would help establish the US title's credibility and continue the really fun story of Strowman ""Not being finished"" with Roman Reigns. Both guys would put on a really fun, destructive match, leading to Strowman winning his first singles title clean. This loss would help both men, setting Strowman up to be a monster to conquer on the Raw side, building him up as a main eventer, while Roman can go back into the World title scene after taking a sabbatical for the US title. 
4. Bayley (c) vs Charlotte Flair vs Sasha Banks vs Nia Jax (Raw Women's Title): I had debated possibly making this a triple threat without Nia, or a 1v1 being Bayley vs Sasha, but both ladies at this time should have been at the Mania card, so I wanted to keep this match. It was a fun little elimination match, where I wouldn't change the outcome of Bayley getting a great Mania title defense. From here, I just wanted to destroy Bayley's character and title reign, because the Alexa Bliss storyline is what did it for her. Have Bayley establish herself as Raw's top woman, and then lose it around Juneish to Alexa. 
5. Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg: Amazing match, but it didn't need to be for the title. I think Brock's top priority at this point should have been redeeming his loss against Goldberg and trying to become the Beast he was before. They can have the same car crash match, with Brock Lesnar winning. Brock can then make his comeback, challenging the Universal champion around the summer, whether it's at Great Balls of Fire or SummerSlam. 
6. Seth Rollins vs Triple H: This was a fun match that established Rollins as a top baby face for Raw, ended the long storyline of the Authority, and the relationship between Rollins and Triple H. I'd keep this match, having Seth Rollins win. 
7. Alexa Bliss (c) vs Naomi vs Becky Lynch vs Carmella vs Mickie James vs Natalya vs Nikki Bella vs Maryse (Women's SmackDown Land of Opportunity 8-Pack Challenge SmackDown Women's Title): This match is pretty much the same, just with the inclusion of Nikki Bella and Maryse. Just have all 8 women have a cluster of a match, with their being a lot of spots. There could be a moment of the match, where it's similar to all the wrestlers attacking Nikki Bella as a favorite (similar to what would happen to Cena being a favorite). Naomi would still get her hometown victory, being a 2x SmackDown Women's champion. 
8. Kevin Owens (c) vs Chris Jericho (Universal Title): I had debated heavily having this be the Main Event of WrestleMania as it was the best storyline heading into Mania 33. But because of multiple headlines that could happen at the main event and Jericho leaving shortly after this, I decided to make this the ""co-main event."" In this story, Kevin Owens never lost his Universal Title to Goldberg and betrayed Chris Jericho at the Festival of Friendship. In his match against Goldberg at Fastlane, rather than Jericho coming out to distract Owens, leading to his loss, it is Brock Lesnar who beat up Goldberg before the match, heavily injuring him. Owens would take advantage of this, giving Owens one of the biggest wins of his career, beating Goldberg. Afterwards, he'd celebrate, but would be attacked by Jericho from behind. Jericho would challenge him for the Universal title, and would be made by Mick Foley. I think both men could have a longer match, which would be more emotionally driven. Owens would go to hit the apron Powerbomb, but it would get turned into a Codebreaker. Jericho would bring Owens back into the ring, put him into the Walls of Jericho, tapping out KO in the ring. Chris Jericho would celebrate in the ring, becoming the third ever Universal champion, and for the first time in WWE.  With Jericho leaving soon, I would use this to have a quick title reign, and lose the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royale winner, Samoa Joe, due to the interference of Kevin Owens. Owens and Jericho would both continue their feud on SmackDown, while Samoa Joe would become the top heel of Raw. This would eventually set up a feud in the summer of Samoa Joe vs Brock Lesnar. 
9. Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson (c) vs Enzo Amore and Big Cass vs The Bar vs The Hardys (Raw Tag Title Ladder Match): This match was perfect with the incredible return and reaction of the Hardys. The Hardys come out and win the Raw Tag title, hopefully having a more meaningful run with the belts. 
10. AJ Styles (c) vs John Cena (WWE Title): As much as I debated having Owens and Jericho having the Main Event spot, having the final match in the riviarly of Cena vs Styles (the one the had a Royal Rumble) would have been a super meaningful match and an amazing main event. AJ Styles had the best year of any wrestler in 2016, so I feel having him main event would have rewarded him for his efforts. In this version, AJ Styles doesn't have his match with Cena at the Rumble, but instead Cena is the one who wins the Rumble. Styles would have fought Bray Wyatt, which would have led to the eventual betrayal of Orton (who wanted the title match over Wyatt). Cena would await the winner of the Elimination Chamber, for the WWE title: AJ Styles vs Randy Orton vs Bray Wyatt vs Dolph Ziggler vs Baron Corbin vs Dean Ambrose. Styles would win, setting up the third match in the trilogy between Cena vs Styles. Cena would tell Styles in the build that he needs to win, establish himself as the 16-time World Champion, knowing that this could be the last WrestleMania he ever main events. (Maina 41 says hello). Both men put on an incredible match, similar to the match we got at Royal Rumble 2017 in real life. At the end, Cena would become the champion and celebrate in the ring.  You can even do the wedding proposal here if you want to include Nikki Bella, where he can give her the ring. Both celebrate ending Mania 33 on a high note. Now I know that John Cena would not be back afterward, but I believe that the SmackDown after WrestleMania, John Cena can have one more match, being a WWE title open challenge, akin to what he did with the US title. This would main event SmackDown, and none other than Shinsuke Nakamura would debut. He'd have an awesome match against John Cena, leading to Nakamura getting the shocking win, becoming WWE champion on his first night on SmackDown. With SmackDown being the theme of the land of opportunity, they have a fresh set of champions that never were really on top all that much (Nakamura, Dillinger, Naomi, American Alpha), and will lead SmackDown into the new era. Heading into the 2017-2018 year, Nakamura would get the big push that Mahal had gotten (not saying that Mahal could become US champion later in the year), which would eventually lead to AJ Styles wanting to regain the WWE title. This would lead to the champion Shinsuke Nakamura vs AJ Styles at Mania 34 that year.

1k1mtiz,nuzlocke,Polished Crystal Nuzlocke: An Herbal Themed Disaster Garden,"Hello all! I had mentioned doing a generationlocke a few days ago, but found myself losing steam and had to do something to keep it interesting. I wish I could be one of those artists who can whip up amazing art, but I can't. I *can* write, however. So, welcome! 

Standard nuzlocke rules apply here. I decided to go with a naming theme of Herbs/Nature. I'm using the rom hack [Pokemon Polished Crystal.](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-polished-crystal-update-3-1-1.373172/)

\---

**Trainer: Kelpi (LadyKelpi if you're nasty)**

**Theme: Herbal & Nature**

# Entry 001

Started the journey with a male Cyndaquil. I named him Cayenne—he's mild-natured, quiet, and warm in every sense of the word. Keeps glancing back at me like he's already accepted the burden of leadership. I didn't ask for a responsible child, but here we are.

**First route, first loss.** Caught a Sentret and didn't even get a chance to name him before he fainted. The grief is… surprising. I barely knew him. But he was mine.

Found a Caterpie on Route 30—**Nettle**, female, and *absolutely feral.* She's tiny, sassy, and full of opinions. Might start a fight with a Pidgey just for looking at her funny. Cayenne seems both amused and mildly concerned.

Route 31 gave me a **docile Bellsprout** I named **Basil**. He's a sweetheart, all floppy vines and worried expressions. He keeps trying to make peace between Cayenne and Nettle. Poor thing.

Entered Dark Cave (stupid) and caught a male Zubat—**Licorice**. Also docile. He doesn't say much, mostly hangs upside down. I think Nettle is convinced he's a vampire. Basil is scared of him.

Sprout Tower gifted me **Clover**, a hasty female Rattata. She's fast, reckless, and already bit my shoe. She and Nettle are either going to be best friends or the reason I wipe.

Party so far:

🌶️ Cayenne (Cyndaquil) ♂ — Mild 

🐛 Nettle (Caterpie) ♀ — Sassy 

🌿 Basil (Bellsprout) ♂ — Docile 

🦇 Licorice (Zubat) ♂ — Docile 

🐭 Clover (Rattata) ♀ — Hasty 

It's early yet. But I already feel weirdly protective of this disaster garden.

# Entry 002

Ventured into **Sprout Tower**, where everyone and their Bellsprout thinks they're hot stuff.

Cayenne is now Level 11 and very aware that he is, in fact, the only reason we haven't all died. I tried letting the others take on some of the Sages' Pokémon—Nettle insisted she could handle a Hoothoot. She could not. Cayenne stepped in with a very calm Ember, like a tired parent picking up a mess.

Most battles were easy pickings. The team ranges from Level 5 to 7, and despite the difference in strength, they're trying their best. Basil got in a few hits and immediately apologized afterward. Licorice avoided eye contact. Clover stole an Berry off the floor, I think.

Then we hit the final floor and ran into *Him.*

The rival. Rude as hell. Smelled like X Attack and trauma. He spoke about Pokemon being the strongest, but I honestly wasn't paying attention. 

Then came the big cheese of Sprout Tower: the Elder Li. 

His team: **Hoothoot, Ghastly, and Bellsprout**.

Mine: Out of potions.

Cayenne took out the Ghastly with Ember, but it was a close call. Licorice was paralyzed just watching from the sidelines. We pulled through, barely. The Bellsprout battle came down to the wire. No heals left, team hanging by a thread, and Cayenne still held the line.

He didn't even look smug. Just tired.

Everyone else is leveling up slowly, but he's starting to feel more like a guardian than a starter. He's not just the team's flame—he's their backbone.

Party so far:

🌶️ Cayenne (Cyndaquil) ♂ – Mild – Team Dad, emotionally exhausted

🐛 Nettle (Caterpie) ♀ – Sassy – Thinks she's invincible, is not

🌿 Basil (Bellsprout) ♂ – Docile – Tried to reason with a ghost

🦇 Licorice (Zubat) ♂ – Docile – Suspiciously chill in a haunted tower

🐭 Clover (Rattata) ♀ – Hasty – Bit someone's ankle mid-battle

We survived Sprout Tower. Barely. No deaths, but a lot of feelings. Time to stock up on potions and emotionally regroup.

# Entry 003

Grind time. No Rare Candy code. No mercy.

The plan was simple: get everyone to at least Level 10 before facing Falkner. The reality? Endless wild battles, faint hope, and way too many Pidgeys.

**Licorice** confused a Pidgey and it hit itself so hard the damage *tripled* what he could've done. Honestly? I respect that. Passive aggression is a valid combat strategy.

**Nettle** tried to take on another Pidgey. (It was totally a brave challenge and *not* me misclicking) Took a hit to the face and lost half her HP. Cayenne stepped in like, *""You good?""* and cleaned up. Again.

After what felt like 40 years of bird punching, I finally felt ready to test the waters in the Gym—only to be told that **Falkner is in the Dark Cave.**

You know. That place where I already caught Licorice. That's cool. That's great. Love it when Gym Leaders go off on side quests *before* I can get my badge.

Party update:

🌶️ Cayenne (Cyndaquil) ♂ – Mild – Carried the team through 87 Pidgey battles

🐛 Nettle (Caterpie) ♀ – Sassy – Would've died from a misclick, still mad about it

🌿 Basil (Bellsprout) ♂ – Docile – Useless against birds, but emotionally supportive

🦇 Licorice (Zubat) ♂ – Docile – Weaponized confusion and emotional distance

🐭 Clover (Rattata) ♀ – Hasty – Still chewing on something, possibly a Gym trainer

Progress: Minimal. Spirit: Withered. Morale: boosted only by the fact that Cayenne hasn't quit on us yet.

Time to go spelunking for a wayward Gym Leader and hope no one dies doing it.

# Entry 004

Took a trip back into **Dark Cave**, but now it's just *Regular Cave* because **Basil used Flash** like a king and instantly became the team's designated spelunker. It's still dark emotionally, but at least I can see where I'm going.

Found **Falkner** heroically taking down an **Ursaring** with his Pidgeotto. Apparently it was attacking weak trainers and he *had to do something about it.* Great job, bird boy. Very noble.

Me: ""Hey, can I battle you for a badge?""

Falkner: ""Sure. Meet me at the gym.""

Backtracking to Violet City, I ran into a stray trainer I somehow missed. It was an easy win—Cayenne basically sneezed and the opponent fainted.

Then it happened. **Cayenne evolved.**

He's a Quilava now. Sleek. Strong. Still emotionally exhausted. But now with more firepower and slightly better posture.

Headed into the Gym to test the waters. In my infinite wisdom, I walked in with a team mostly at **Level 8-9**. What could go wrong?

Answer: **Clover almost DIED.**

First trainer's Pidgey got a crit, and she barely survived with **1 HP**. I think she bit it out of spite on her way down. Cayenne stepped in. Again.

It's time. I'm going to destroy another generation of Pidgey and maybe steal their inheritance to make sure my team doesn't have to go through that again. Badge incoming.

Party update:

🔥 Cayenne (Quilava) ♂ – Mild – Evolved, burned a bear, may be my therapist

🐛 Nettle (Caterpie) ♀ – Sassy – Still talking trash from the back lines

🌿 Basil (Bellsprout) ♂ – Docile – Illuminated the cave, might start a book club

🦇 Licorice (Zubat) ♂ – Docile – Observes and judges, rarely speaks

🐭 Clover (Rattata) ♀ – Hasty – Alive by sheer willpower and salt

Pray for Falkner. And pray for his birds.

# Entry 005

Went back to Route 36 for faster leveling and ran into a **Growlithe** with a **crit complex** and **Flash Fire**. We found out the hard way that setting him on fire only makes him stronger.

He also crit **Clover**—again—and she hung on with **1 HP**—again. This is not a joke. She is immortal. The Growlithe? He's **Rowan** now. Bold. Fiery. Has bite marks.

Then it was off to Route 32, where we met a **sassy Ekans** who gave off immediate *witchy trouble vibes*. I named her **Sassafras.** She slithered into the team like she owned the place.

Made the painful decision to let **Nettle** rest in the Box. She's got heart, but one gust of wind and she'd be Pidgey chow. She'll keep the Box in line.

And then—**montage time.**

**Clover** was shaky at first, dodging crits like a gymnast, but at **Lv. 10** she learned **Bite**. Now she's chaining Bite → Quick Attack and flinching enemies out of existence.

**Sassafras** didn't get flashy—just **Wrap → Poison Sting** and left a trail of bodies. Girl's venomous and she knows it.

**Licorice** was struggling. Confusion damage does more than her actual attacks, but then… **Bite** happened. Now she's floating into battle like she's entering a rave and leaving a crime scene.

**Basil**... tried to take on a Pidgey. Poor boy. Immediate regret. **Cayenne had to save him.** Again. We still love him.

**Rowan**, meanwhile, stepped up. He's started acting as **Cayenne's backup**, swooping in when someone's on the ropes. **Ember here, Bite there, done.**

The team feels solid. No longer just passengers on the Cayenne Express. We're still a disaster garden—but now we bite back.

**Round Two with Falkner.**

He's not ready.

**🌶️ Current Party Recap:**

🔥 Cayenne (Quilava) ♂ – Lv. 15 – Mild – Team Dad, leader, fireproof therapist

🐭 Clover (Rattata) ♀ – Lv. 13 – Hasty – The unkillable rat gremlin with Bite

🐍 Sassafras (Ekans) ♀ – Lv. 12 – Sassy – Wrap + poison queen, suspiciously smug

🦇 Licorice (Zubat) ♀ – Lv. 12 – Docile – Flinch demon, darkness enthusiast

🌿 Basil (Bellsprout) ♂ – Lv. 10 – Docile – Sweet baby vine, emotionally healing

🌲 Rowan (Growlithe) ♂ – Lv. 10 – Bold – Fire knight, noble backup hitter

That's all for now, folks! Unfortunately, I can't figure out a cheat code that works with Pokemon Polished Crystal, so I can't use rare candies to help level everyone. That's okay though, it gives me a lot to work with.

17rk7b7,StockMarket,US Steel $X rises -,"US Steel $X quickly ticked higher, though it has since gone negative amid a report that ArcelorMittal $MT is in the lead position to acquire the steelmaker. They are speculated to be in advanced discussions with Societe Generale and Credit Agricole to finance its bid for US Steel $X, according to a Betaville ""uncooked"" alert on Wednesday. There's some speculation that MT is teamed up with Nippon Steel $NISTF in its bid for US Steel.

The latest updates come after Bloomberg reported Thursday that final bids for US Steel (X) are expected shortly after some site visits next week. CNBC's Faber said he expects the sales process may be completed by the end of the month.

In August, US Steel (X) said it entered into confidentiality agreements with ""numerous"" third parties. US Steel (X) started a formal review process after rejecting the Cliffs (CLF) bid. US Steel (X) rejected a $7.3 billion cash and stock bid from Cliffs (CLF) in August.

FIRE sounds possible based on simple 4% withdraw rate or ficalc.app. However, unlike super which doesn't attract CGT after retirement, It is hard to calculate if my retirement fund will last 30+ years as the CGT increases over years.

e.g.  I want 100k pa in the 1st year of retirement. I will need 128k (after-tax) 10 years later (assuming 2.5% inflation) and 163k after 20 years.

When the asset continues to grow, CGT at each withdrawn grows too. That means my withdrawn rate increases over time to maintain the same purchasing power. The risk of running out of fund is higher when inflation is higher than the last 40 years like 70s - 80s

ATO changes the tax brackets regularly may offset the CGT growth a little bit but it's still a big ? whether the retirement fund will last.

The sensor is in the pump chamber, chamber 3, which is always a bit lower than the other 2 chambers. The fact that it fluctuates makes me nervous and there’s a flow situation going on.. 

In chamber one I have bio cubes, chemipure elite, and filter floss. I change the filter floss every 3-5 days. In chamber two I only have the stock foam. I gave it good rinse this morning and put it back in.  

Any other tips? Should I remove the stock foam and move the Chemipure to chamber 2 and add more bio cubes? I like the idea of the foam but wonder if it’s just creating a grimey clogging situation.

1jwwpmn,wallstreetbetsGER,Zusammenfassung der letzten 3 Monate,"Willkommen in der Klapse: r/wallstreetbetsgermany – Elmo wird geshortet, die Orange gehasst, Atos zur Sonne

Vergiss Wall Street. Vergiss DAX. Vergiss rationales Denken. Auf r/wallstreetbetsgermany herrschen Wahnsinn, Memes, Größenwahn und 100er Hebel. Hier werden in der Mittagspause mehr Knock-Outs verbrannt als bei einem Grillfest in der Hölle. Willkommen in der toxischsten Investment-Selbsthilfegruppe des Internets.


---

Elmo – vom Tech-Messias zum Meme-Müll

Elon ""Elmo"" Musk, früher gefeiert wie ein Gott, wird jetzt mit 100er Hebel rasiert wie ein Golden Retriever im Hochsommer. Jeder Tweet? Ein Shortsignal. Jedes neue Produkt? ""Wird eh nie geliefert."" Die Community hasst Elmo mit einer Leidenschaft, die normalerweise nur reserviert ist für Steuerprüfer und kaputte Take-Profit-Orders. Tesla ist für sie das neue Wirecard – nur ohne den sympathischen Betrugs-Charme.


---

Die Orange – Zölle, Wut und gesperrte Broker

Donald Trump, in liebevollem Hass nur ""die Orange"" genannt, hat es geschafft, das gesamte Subreddit zu vereinen – in kollektiver Abscheu. Der Grund: Zölle auf alles, was blinkt. China? Zölle. Europa? Zölle. Atos? Bald auch Zölle. Jeder neue Zoll führt zu spontanen Massensuiziden in den Depots der Community. Seine Tweets bringen mehr Knock-Outs als ein MMA-Finale – und jedes Mal ist der Wutpegel höher als der Hebel.


---

Fettbürger & Dirk Müller – die echten Feinde des Fortschritts

ETF-Sparer? Fettbürger. Dividendenjäger? Fettbürger. Wer nicht täglich mit einem 50er-Hebel auf eine Litauen-Aktie wettet, gehört laut Subreddit in den Sparbuch-Knast. Besonders gehasst: Dirk Müller. Sein Premiumfonds ist so langweilig, dass selbst Excel beim Tracking einnickt. Kein Wunder, dass selbst die memehaftesten Papiere wie Tonnerdrones und Rheiner den Fonds um das 100-Fache outperformt haben – in der Werbungspause von Galileo.


---

Tonnerdrones & Rheiner – YOLO mit Siegel

Was für den Rest der Welt wie Penny-Stocks mit Burnout wirkt, sind auf r/wallstreetbetsgermany heilige Gräle. Tonnerdrones? ""Hat mehr Potenzial als Nvidia – man muss es nur sehen wollen.""
Rheiner? ""Baut ein Monopol auf in... irgendwas. Egal. Long!""
Hier wird geinvestiert mit Bauchgefühl, Kaffeesatz und dem letzten Rest Hoffnung. DDs bestehen aus drei Memes, einem TikTok-Video und der Behauptung, „mein Onkel kennt da einen“. Fakten? Für Fettbürger.


---

Atos – Kursrakete, Kult, Koks auf vier Buchstaben

Atos ist kein Investment. Atos ist Religion.
Während Außenstehende googeln: ""Was macht Atos eigentlich?"", fliegt das Subreddit längst zum Mond. Nein, zur Sonne.
„Buy the Dip“? Die Dip-Käufer wurden selbst gedippt – aber trotzdem: Atos ist geil.
Die Aktie ist so wild, sie braucht keinen Chart. Sie macht einfach, was sie will – und der Subreddit jubelt. Ob +300 % oder -80 % – Diamond Hands bis zum Pflegegrad.


---

Fazit:

r/wallstreetbetsgermany ist keine Community – es ist eine Finanz-Meme-Extrem-Sekte mit Zockerlizenz.
Hier wird Elmo geshortet, Trump verflucht, Fettbürger gejagt, Dirk Müller ausgelacht, Tonnerdrones vergöttert, Rheiner mit Laseraugen versehen und Atos mit Raketen-Emojis in die Atmosphäre geschossen. Wer nüchtern reinschaut, geht verwirrt. Wer mitmacht, geht broke – aber mit Stil.

To the Sonne, Brüder.

1jwaub9,NBA_Draft,Not a single freshman in NCAA history has been as inefficient in scoring and playmaking as Ace Bailey and made the allstar game,"I can’t edit the title but as it turns out Andre Drummond did do worse in both categories. Undeserved allstar appearance but I lied a little in the title anyway. Doesn’t change my point though. 

Ace’s ts% and a:to has been extremely concerning this entire year especially for the role he was in. Most players with that kind of profile are center prospects with high defensive upside, not wings who are expected to create shots for themselves and others.

I’m much lower on ace than consensus for this reason. I see him more as a 3nD player with his stocks and c&s 3pt%.

This has been a pre-ncaa issue too, you can’t blame all of it on his teammates. (Especially when his ft% is awful) 🤮

I'll most likely go to matsumoto kiyoshi or donki to get some cheap drugstore skincare (maybe cosme too) but while looking at products on the stores' websites, none of them seem to stock illiyoon products? (at least online)

I know illiyoon is a kbeauty brand but most Japanese stores do sell many kbeauty products, especially in recent years, and illiyoon is my HG for irritated travel skin, does anybody know if they sell it in japan?

edit: are there products similar to the illiyoon ato lotion that are commonly found in japan? I've given up hope haha",illiyoon products japan,im going japan next week current illiyoon ato ceramide lotion last legs probably run trip order another amazon wont arrive time ill likely go matsumoto kiyoshi donki get cheap drugstore skincare maybe cosme looking products stores websites none seem stock illiyoon products least online know illiyoon kbeauty brand japanese stores sell many kbeauty products especially recent years illiyoon hg irritated travel skin anybody know sell japan edit products similar illiyoon ato lotion commonly found japan ive given hope haha,0.84,Regional,['ATO'],negative,0.9994726777076721,negative,0.9999901056289673

1js9qpl,Vitards,[YOLO Update] (No Longer) Going All In On Steel (+🏴‍☠️) Update #80. America's self created economic crisis.,"# General Update

In the [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/1jalopz/yolo_update_no_longer_going_all_in_on_steel/), I became convinced that the Trump administration was serious about tariffs. That post marked an interim bottom as the market decided tariffs weren't going to happen once again. (I had sold the day before and had been in all cash). I've traded in small size since that update with the exception of buying 20 year bonds going into ""liberation day"" that I would sell for a few percentage points of profit (it was a safer way of holding market puts to me).

""Liberation Day"" arrived on April 2nd and in what was a complete surprise to the markets, we got tariffs that had been promised consistently for months. The market suddenly decided it needed to take America committing economic suicide seriously and thus we had a 10% down move in the S&P500 in 2 days. [This table](https://bsky.app/profile/crampell.bsky.social/post/3llzc3fmf7s23) puts the move in perspective as the 5th biggest two day combined drop in history and is on the scale of COVID / Lehman Bank collapse.

I figured I'd do an update on things. For the usual disclaimer up front, **the following is not financial advice and I could be wrong about anything in this post.** This is just my thought process for how I am playing my personal investment portfolio.

# General Macro

The situation is really bad. The way the tariff rates were calculated makes little sense and may as well have been rolls from a d100 dice. Making things worse is just how impossible it is to figure out the actual plan here. Not helping things are:

* Treasury Secretary Bessent seriously tried to float the idea that selloff was due to continued AI stock weakness from Deepseek rather than a response to Trump's tariffs. \[[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/02/treasury-secretary-bessent-says-market-woes-are-more-about-tech-stock-sell-off-than-trumps-tariffs.html)\]
* Israel dropped their tariffs on the USA to 0% but still got hit with a 17% tariff rate \[[source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-israel-fails-to-win-reprieve-from-trumps-tariffs-will-its-economy-be-hit/)\]. If dropping all tariffs aren't enough, what is the USA administration aiming for here?
* The administration isn't making a showing of trying to get a deal Trump spent Friday golfing on a golf course which is terrible for optics that something is being worked on. \[[Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-tariffs-golf-813c7a300021445636f63fddbfd38c83)\]
* Messaging straight from Trump hasn't outlined non-imaginary benefits. [This one](https://bsky.app/profile/josephpolitano.bsky.social/post/3lm2yhvhyp22j) claims other countries are being hurt harder (a message that our pain is ok as long as it causes others more pain) and then [this one](https://fox40.com/news/national-and-world-news/trump-tells-investors-to-buy-low-this-is-a-great-time-to-get-rich/) about how ""this is a great time to get rich"" without outlining how that would occur.
* Republicans + businesses are too afraid of going against Trump yet to be a potential limiter on bad policy. \[[Source](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/04/trump-tariffs-fear-lobby-business-congress-00006608)\]

It wasn't just the market that ignored the economic threat of tariffs. All corporations have mostly ignored them in their planning - and this is reflected by the fact we [got a good jobs number of +228k](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/march-2025-jobs-report-whos-hiring-firing-trump-layoffs-economy-rcna198645) on Friday (April 4th). Even if tariffs were completely removed today, the uncertainty around what kind of crazy policies the administration might do next combined with the increasingly sour public perception of the USA in other countries will likely put a temporary freeze on hiring. Basically there is no outcome were we don't see less jobs due to what happened on April 2nd. Already we are seeing this in some manufacturing sectors hit with tariffs earlier as steel producer $CLF had to lay off 1,200 from weak demand in auto production that wouldn't have been in the Non-Farm Payroll jobs report yet ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cleveland-cliffs-lays-off-more-114200251.html)).

Further complicating things is just that reporting should better explain the impact of these tariffs. They are very similar to the US having added a national sales tax and equate to one of the largest tax increases in US history. Going to buy a car? They will include a line item for ""tariffs"" much in the same way one's receipt might have a line item for ""sales tax"" ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-introduce-import-fee-tariff-hit-cars-wsj-reports-2025-04-03/)). The base price remains the same except one is paying extra for the new tax. An iPhone will cost less in Europe than the USA. The new Nintendo Switch 2 will cost less in Japan ([source](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-made-a-much-cheaper-japanese-language-only-nintendo-switch-2-and-even-duolingo-is-poking-fun)) and Nintendo just [delayed pre-orders](https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-price-tariff-trump-nintendo-1851774764) while they likely wait to see if they need to also add their own tariff line item. Lots of articles about how this is just inflation but that doesn't give the right mental model. Stuff gets more expensive just like a national sales tax might do - but it is an increase felt only by Americans rather than everyone in the world that lowers the American standard of living and reduces sales volume in the country hitting corporate profits.

But surely companies will move production to within the USA to avoid tariffs? That isn't how things work in reality. Car makers that were targeted early in this process have stated they won't be doing so ([source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/cars/us-automakers-production-tariffs-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html)). It just isn't feasible to ramp up US production immediately and they would rather wait out the pain. Congress can stop the tariffs at any point - and a recession means Democrats win the midterms and undue to tariffs in 1.5 years. This is why steel companies are struggling: this isn't an effective way to spur domestic production. Even if tariffs were the tool one wanted to use for that over incentives, one needs for it to be gradual and well communicated beforehand to give time for supply chains to be moved. This ""go large and announce them right before they are effective"" approach is the absolute dumbest way to try to use that tool.

I mentioned last time that this was equivalent to the UK's ""Brexit"" in that a country is choosing to hurt its own economic prosperity. It is hard to imagine but it somehow does happen. To his credit, Trump was honest about his economic plans and voters put him in power despite all of the warnings from economists. It is hard to overstate how economically illiterate the current USA administration is and how difficult it is for those in charge to recognize when they are wrong.

**Thoughts From Myself**

The market is suddenly attempting to price in the economic destruction tariffs will cause. However: the majority of it doesn't go into affect until April 9th with China's counter tariffs going into effect on April 10th \[[tariff schedule here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-the-unilateral-10-tariff-on-imports-takes-effect-191201149.html)\]. That means the tariffs haven't become ""real"" yet and I imagine some market participants will want to take the bet that a deal is struck before they go into effect. It is human nature to assume there is a sane plan behind the scenes - but as I've tried to outline in these recent updates, this is America's Brexit. As such, I believe those trying to apply rationality to the situation will only continue to get burned. But I believe that bet will be attractive to those who hold different views than myself.

I also believe that some of the current extreme selloff was forced deleveraging. The ""DailyMail"" adds weight to many hedge funds facing margin calls ([source](https://bsky.app/profile/unusualwhales.bsky.social/post/3lm3gyznm7c2x)). Even outside of forced selling, I imagine many ran for the exit as if I had calls deep underwater on Friday, I'd consider capitulating going into the weekend and salvaging what I could of my account to maintain mental sanity.

I further have expected some minor trade agreement announcements this weekend. There was a small bounce in some stocks like $NKE on Friday due to a ""trade talks with Vietnam going well"" comment \[[source](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/vietnam-foreign-ministry-says-regrets-us-tariff-decision-2025-04-04/)\]. That hasn't happened yet and instead it has thus far just been more confirmation with Trump restating tariffs are here to stay \[[source](https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lm32etatyc2k)\]. I still expect it to occur though - and the market to react to it as a sign that the tariffs won't really stick. But such agreements would be ""the low hanging fruit"" - the countries most desperate to make a deal. The real Trade War will be with those better situated to refuse to bend the knee. Furthermore: any agreements that are made would need to be quite lucrative to the USA to make up for the economic damage that has already occurred.

Given all of that, I bought at the end of Friday as I see at least a short term bounce from bets of a good outcome before April 9th / April 10th. I'd likely sell into that bounce for those making that bet. We could continue down on Monday - but I'd expect a retest of $SPY 500 before that date to exit. This is because I could also be wrong about the situation and everything is resolved over the next few weeks and the market goes back to ATH levels. That is a reasonable risk / reward bet at these levels and while I view the odds of success as low, I believe others will disagree with my assessment to take it.

If I am completely wrong about that paragraph? I own shares. Eventually the administration will change and economic damage is never completely permanent. On the 10+ year horizon, the S&P500 will likely still have gone up.

I'm doing shares only as IV is insane right now. [This tweet](https://xcancel.com/spotgamma/status/1908260628675866976) outlines how a call could lose money despite a 2% bounce in $SPY from IV crush. Right now call options require extreme moves to pay off right now and really limit the cases one can make money on a trade. One could sell puts or do spreads - but I decided to just keep it simple. 

The focus was on the indexes mainly due to how the market was trying to rally 15 minutes before close on Friday and only started to dump with around 5 minutes remaining. There wasn't much time to pick and choose and I wasn't sure how AH pricing would shake out. (Note: I had done Individual + 401k BrokerageLink mostly prior to close. IRA account was done AH when things were still going more red). Plus the index is the safest thing should I get stuck holding for the long haul anyway. As a society, America has been trained that the S&P500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes are were our retirement money goes.

No leverage used in the shown positions. I also have some /MNQ and /ES futures contracts in IBKR that are using leverage but they are less contracts than I would normally hold. Again: the goal is limit having to sell if this turns into something I need to just hold for years over continually trying to time things.

To nip one question in the bud: I don't consider steel companies a good investment right now. For the short term, if we get a bounce, everything bounces. If we don't, I'd rather be stuck holding the index / tech over a heavy debt and unprofitable steel company with bad management like $CLF. I'll likely never forget how the $CLF CEO squandered an insane steel pricing power market that they promised they would use to pay off debt and then just didn't really do that. $STLD and $NUE aren't bad companies - but I don't consider them cheap enough yet over just holding the indexes instead.

# Conclusions

To summarize: I'm short term bullish as I think the market has priced in too much recession certainty from policies that haven't yet gone into affect. I'm long term bearish as I believe the market isn't wrong but that is just how I personally would bet. I don't think that is an objective outcome yet and there are scenarios where I would be incorrect in my best guess prediction. Should I be wrong about at least a near term bounce, my positions are designed to held until policy eventually changes.

All of this is still ""timing the market"" over ""time in the market""... but I've been doing alright with that. It goes against almost all proven retirement investing advice and I am aware of that. My worst case is just doing the standard practice of then holding the S&P500 and Nasdaq long term though which I don't consider a terrible outcome considering I would have bought in 20% below the recent peak still.

If I do end up selling, I'll likely post a message on my Bluesky account. I don't plan to do another update until the macro changes again which won't be until later in April when everyone has full clarity on what tariffs have stuck around. It really is nothing more than guesswork on what things will look like in a few weeks right now.

1js8s1o,tiredofwallstreetbutt,"If tariffs encourage companies to return to the U.S., these companies will benefit
Published Sat, Apr 5 20259:07 AM EDT

Michelle Fox
@MFoxCNBC","Stocks have fallen sharply in the aftermath of President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)’s tariffs, but there are some names that may ultimately benefit as companies return operations to the United States, according to two financial firms.

Trump vowed to bring factories and jobs back to the country when he signed a [sweeping tariff policy](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-live-updates-retaliation-trade-war.html) on Wednesday. It includes reciprocal tariffs that begin at 10%, and rise higher for certain countries. On Friday, China retaliated by [slapping 34% levies](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/china-to-impose-34percent-retaliatory-tariff-on-all-goods-imported-from-the-us.html) on all goods imported from the U.S.

Reshoring, or the return of companies’ overseas operations to the U.S., [isn’t that simple](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/05/trump-says-tariffs-will-accelerate-reshoring-but-experts-say-its-not-that-easy.html) due to uncertainty around the final levies and how long they will last, as well as issues surrounding finding workers and updating infrastructure, experts said. However, there are some names that may eventually walk away winners.

Right now, Morgan Stanley analyst Chris Snyder sees a competitive advantage for U.S. industrials that have production in Mexico. Trump [excluded both Mexico and Canada](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/) from the tariffs announced on Wednesday, which means that USMCA-compliant goods will continue to have 0% levies.

Industrials are over indexed to Mexico, while consumer companies are heavily in Asia, he pointed out. That suggests less tariff inflation on industrials and therefore, less risk of demand destruction, he said.

The top beneficiary of Mexico’s exemption is [Acuity](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AYI/), Snyder said. The Atlanta-based industrial technology company provides light fixtures and building controls.

“The competition is Asia based and will face substantial incremental tariffs,” Snyder said.

He has an overweight rating on the stock and a $370 price target, which implies 44% upside from Thursday’s close. Shares are down about 21% year to date.

# Short-term risk

Snyder anticipates Trump’s tariffs will be a positive catalyst for reshoring, but in the near-term investments will be smaller and focused on quick turnarounds, not a “massive wave.”

He also sees a short-term risk for the country’s manufacturing production economy because companies have built up inventories since the election in anticipation of the levies.

“This looming short-cycle ‘air pocket’ could be deepened by an expectation that tariff rates could be negotiated lower – why buy now if you have excess stock and the price could be going lower?” Snyder wrote in a note Friday.

The most at risk are those exposed to supply chains in Asia and Europe, where negotiations could begin, he said. Right now, he likes short-cycle exposure that is less tied to the consumer and where there are signs of order improvement even prior to the November election.

That includes one of his top reshoring picks, [Rockwell Automation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ROK/). The company is the leader in American factory automation, Snyder said. Its biggest driver is the investment in U.S. manufacturing capital expenditures, which should finally be turning around, he said.

“The market is returning to growth and that gives a lift to their future growth and earning power,” Snyder said.

His $345 price target suggests 44% upside from Thursday’s close.

# $10 billion reshoring opportunity

When businesses are ready to build their next project, they are now more likely to come to the United States, Snyder believes.

“The sheer magnitude of the tariffs should help US take share of global investment - the US accounts for \~30% of global consumption and thus will remain an important market to serve,” he wrote in a note Thursday.

That is in line with his thesis that the country is in the early innings of a multidecade, $10 billion re-industrialization opportunity that will restore growth to the U.S. industrial economy. His other preferred reshoring stock, in addition to Rockwell Automation, is [Eaton](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ETN/)

His $345 price target suggests 44% upside from Thursday’s close.

# $10 billion reshoring opportunity

When businesses are ready to build their next project, they are now more likely to come to the United States, Snyder believes.

“The sheer magnitude of the tariffs should help US take share of global investment - the US accounts for \~30% of global consumption and thus will remain an important market to serve,” he wrote in a note Thursday.

That is in line with his thesis that the country is in the early innings of a multidecade, $10 billion re-industrialization opportunity that will restore growth to the U.S. industrial economy. His other preferred reshoring stock, in addition to Rockwell Automation, is [Eaton](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ETN/)

Eaton is the biggest provider of electrical systems and power management solutions in the country, he said. It should benefit from the increased construction of facilities and connecting them to the grid.

“Investment in the industrial economy will require a lot of investment in power to support that,” he noted.

His price target of $385 suggests the stock can move 48% higher from Thursday’s close.

# Crisis of confidence, eventual opportunity

Societe Generale also sees several reshoring opportunities, but expects some pain first.

Manish Kabra, head of the firm’s U.S. equity strategy, is concerned about the drop in consumer confidence.

“When you have a crisis of confidence, the confidence of global companies that have announced investments in the U.S., they are going to pause,” he said. “Unless we solve the crisis of confidence, the potential investments, the announced investments will not happen at a fast pace. It will slow down.”

Kabra hopes the highest level of tariffs are a negotiation tool and don’t cause a downturn in 2025.

If the tariffs are negotiated, he expects the “crisis of confidence” to ease by the summer or the end of the year. If so, his basket of reshoring stocks will “come out much, much better.”

“If this whole big picture idea is America first and American manufacturing jobs, then this is the basket — these are the stocks they have to work.”

One global supply chain play is [Union Pacific](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UNP/), which connects over 23 states by rail. The stock has an average analyst rating of overweight and 24% upside to the average price target, according to FactSet.

Deutsche Bank [initiated coverage of the stock](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/wall-streets-top-stocks-by-analysts-friday.html) in March with a buy rating. Analyst Richa Harnain said Union Pacific’s operating margin and rate of return on invested capital makes it stand out among its peers.

Shares are down 4% year to date.

One real estate investment trust, [Prologis](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLD/), made the cut. The company owns industrial properties, such as warehouses, and has been [focusing on data centers](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/07/17/data-centers-will-be-driver-business-for-prologis-says-ceo-hamid-moghadam.html), which should benefit from the artificial intelligence boom.

Prologis has an average analyst rating of overweight and has nearly 36% upside to the average price target, per FactSet.

Meanwhile, [Steel Dynamics](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/STLD/) is expected to be a beneficiary of the steel and aluminum duties Trump put into effect in March. The stock was [upgraded by UBS](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/ubs-upgrades-steel-stocks-on-trumps-tariff-protection-for-the-industry.html) to buy from neutral late last month. Analyst Andrew Jones said the tariff protections exceeded his expectations and resulted in a significant rally in hot-rolled coil steel.

“At the same time, the stock has sold off and de-rated with the sell off in the broader market on the escalating trade war,” he wrote in a March 24 note. “We think any demand downside is likely to be partly offset by reshoring efforts (inc 25% on downstream goods) and the import protection is more significant.”

The stock has an average analyst rating of overweight and about 37% upside to the average price target, FactSet data show.

#  Book Descriptions & Covers:



[**How to Make Money in Stocks**](https://amzn.to/3ujiApd) **by William O'Neil**

* This book is about growth investing. O'Neil explains what most successful stocks have done to be successful. He explains his 'CANSLIM' method, which is an acronym for 7 fundamental criteria which you can use to pick stocks. An AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return from 1998-2005 (Second place). First place was Martin Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% (we will get to Zweig on this list too)

# [The Little Book That Still Beats the Market](https://amzn.to/2OfR4d9) by Joel Greenblatt

* The idea of this book is to buy undervalued good businesses and hold them long-term, which will eventually beat the market index.

https://preview.redd.it/qmrq2minng191.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=46dd18b57e2bdc7afb8fa1f5e1ff025615d16a76



# [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3ud6E8A) by Burton G. Malkiel

* This book covers investment bubbles, fundamental vs. technical analysis, modern portfolio theory, index funds, etc.

https://preview.redd.it/x7t5gloong191.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d43edcd511ef371a506419cec2ac8462a7d844a



# [One Up On Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3rEN9E9) by Peter Lynch

* This book emphasizes the advantages that individual investors hold over institutional investors (when it comes to finding investment opportunities). Lynch also gives many of examples of mistakes he has made, and how he has learned from them.

https://preview.redd.it/a3hze2lpng191.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=e94cbc8e20e50f7cd9b92a67c140952529bd0d04



# [The Big Secret for the Small Investor](https://amzn.to/3fHyJ3I) by Joel Greenblatt

* Greenblatt explains why index funds can be better than actively managed funds. The big secret is maintaining a long term perspective!

https://preview.redd.it/qvhszg2qng191.png?width=347&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dc31f381276a372d5cb2eeb1c0afa91fb253454



# [Winning on Wall Street](https://amzn.to/3rH4TyH) by Martin Zweig

* Zweig's success came from his ability to predict the bigger picture (such as trends in the broader market). The combination of his stock picking skill, general market understanding, and market timing, made him one of the great investors of stock market history. Zweig was more interested in growth than value. Unlike Buffett, Zweig isn't a 'buy and hold' investor. An AAII 8 year study of different strategies showed Zwieg's returning 1,659.3% from 1998-2005. He was #1 out of 56 others, including Buffett, Lynch, Fisher, O'Neal's CAN SLIM, Motley fools, and using ROE, P/E's etc. Second place was O'Neal's CAN SLIM with a 860% return.

# [Irrational Exuberance](https://amzn.to/3mbTjKQ) by Robert Shiller

* Shiller makes strong argument that perfect market theory is flawed. The Idea of perfect market theory is basically that the markets are all knowing and completely rational, and in the long run can't be beat. Therefore , you can control costs with index funds and diversification. (You can't beat the market, therefore controlling costs and diversifying seems like logical strategy)

# [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](https://amzn.to/3uaehfS)

* The key concepts of this book are risk tolerance, asset allocation, a balanced portfolio, tax efficiency and cash management. This book explains many of the pitfalls of investing. The Bogleheads and Jack Bogle preach the power of compound interest. Investing in low-fee index funds and holding them long-term is the method. This book gives an excellent, detailed rundown of how to implement this kind of investment plan.

# [Common Sense Investing](https://amzn.to/3ucV0dW) by John Bogle

* Great information for anyone who is trying to make sense of personal finance and basic investments. This book explains why passive investing is a worry free, long-term strategy that consistency wins over time, and why active trading always returns to the mean.

https://preview.redd.it/h7aw2btrng191.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d706a714a567b2e59a27f840328cce4496408f0



# [The Intelligent Investor](https://amzn.to/2PqdzMQ) by Benjamin Graham

* This is a great book for anyone who is interested in introducing themselves into the world of investing, or wants to get better at investing. This book gives lots of valuable information to help one understand the basics of value investing.

# [The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need](https://amzn.to/3ugMSJu) by Andrew Tobias

* This is a book for people looking to learn the basics of investing and saving money

# [You Can Be a Stock Market Genius](https://amzn.to/3meewnv) by Joel Greenblatt

* This is not a book for beginners. Greenblatt gives a nice exposition of some more ""special situation"" investment styles & areas of equity investments (mergers, spin-offs, rights offerings, etc.)

Meanwhile, 10-year bond yields rising from around 4.00% to 4.20%. Could this mean investors believe that we're nearing the dip? The market was expecting the first rate cut in June, but May percentage are increasing.

High volatility day ends, but the result stays the same. The stock market closed red again and extended the losing streak to 3 days. We finally saw a few green stocks on the map. Who's going to save us from this situation? Will the Fed step in with an early rate cut or will Trump ease the impact of these tariffs?

1k1i3jg,InnerCircleInvesting,"Market Digest (4/17) - Earnings, Economy, $NVDA/$TSM + Random Shots","As I type this, markets are trading in the middle of the recent range after yet another turbulent week. I posted yesterday that we are, for the most part, still bouncing around within that range while we wait for some combination of good earnings news, tariff deals, economic reports or anything else to build a bit of confidence. Here is the 1-Year chart for the S&P:

[S&P500 1-year ](https://preview.redd.it/tj7qajv82fve1.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=d48bbf4a84663bcbf8349eaec9500369132e0654)



**Earnings**

We're in an interesting place with earnings in that FI numbers were great, $TSM last night was very good and the rear view mirror looks about as expected. If only we could move forward while looking backward. $NFLX is on deck and the stocks continues to be talked-up, owned and it's performing relatively well.

And, of course, CEOs have no idea how to model the future and guidance is receiving all the focus. In my estimation, the 'smart' companies will just say what we all know - the future is uncertain and we can't offer guidance at this time. We all understand it and I think Mr. Market will be okay with it.

I don't want to say that companies are going to be given a pass but the focus isn't on what has been but, instead, what's to come. That's the environment that has been orchestrated. 

And if you haven't read my recent post about the ""E"" in P/E, you should probably do so now.

Just look at $UNH for an example of this. I was looking for $450 as a potential buy area but didn't expect we would see it in a single day. But, here we are.

**Economy**

It's a real mess and eyes have turned to recession and inflation, with full understanding that tariffs have damaged our previously bullish environment and ushered in much uncertainty. There's no way to have a level of confidence about where we're at or what 'quip' may be offered at a moment's notice.

Trump is back on the warpath related to Chair Powell, all but calling for his sacking ... while his office staff were quick to say that was not the message. There's no Fed rescue here and inflation is going to head higher. I just don't see a way out of the eventuality. And if the Fed cuts rate here ... it goes from arguable to a certainty. Oh, and the first rate cut is expected in June. 

Companies are already raising prices and aren't even hiding it. It's almost to the point where CEOs are speaking to Trump directly by saying ""this is what you get"" in what amounts to a scapegoating move. 

**Random Shots**

It's been a while since I've highlighted issues on my watchlist, mostly because I'm having a hard time making a case for any current price level, value name or not. It goes back to what I've said about technical analysis. All of it falls away when overarching market events render the T.A. points somewhat meaningless or arbitrary. Support levels can't withstand greater impact events.

Let's spin around my watchlist and I'll give you my thoughts on some of the higher profile issues.

$NVDA - Trimmed 20% around $113 (as I recall) late last week on no remaining upside catalysts that I felt good about. Wish I would have trusted my gut and trimmed 50%. I just don't want to time this thing too tightly. I'll be adding back those 20% shares some point soon. We can't lose sight of the long-term prospects here and they remain intact in my mind.

$TSM - Hard not to be excited about this price level after those earnings. But, of course, forward guidance is anything but certain and I think we'll be overlooking near term reports.

$AMZN - I'm surprised it's still in the $170s. It's a compelling valuation in regular times and a cautious buy even in the middle of this storm.

$AVGO - I want to add more here but won't because I can't say there's not another10% haircut coming. I have enough weight now and not willing to commit more cash here.

$GOOGL - Fighting more monopoly rulings from the government. How long has this been going on now? Not sure what to think and I haven't added to my new position after selling it all much higher. No rush on this one and now the fears about search and ChatGPT are resurfacing yet again. 

AI Energy plays are firming up of late but I haven't added more shares since my last purchases. Still focused on $CEG $VST and $TLN, with positions in the first two.

$ABBV - Hard not to add shares down here with the attached dividend.

$AMGN - Same as $ABBV, may be adding more.

$BABA - I want another 2 units of this play. Already bought one near $108 and almost pulled the trigger on the next unit near $100 but missed it. ""Missed it"" is my motto with BABA.

$CLF - Waiting impatiently. Will add another, and last, unit in the low $6s

$CROX - Don't own CROX but that last earnings report was very good and it's well off of highs, near a 52WL. I've chosen $DECK so I'll stick with that.

$CRWV - I have lost sight of this one as it now has a 3-handle on it again. Would love to see it tank into the low $30s but seems unlikely.

$DECK - Still waiting to add my 'last' 1/2 unit entry. I could still add another U after that but have no plans. I just don't want to lock up too much cash in this name but think this is a double from here in 12-18 mos.

$DELL - Still a stellar combo stock of income + growth. I'm not sure why I'm not in the name other than I'm focused elsewhere and have been reluctant to commit cash to new positions.

$DLR - Has been strong of late and with attached income. I think you can still add near $150

$META -  I may be purchasing a trading position, or even calls, in this name here at $500

$NEM - Gold. What a run. Beautiful ""U"" pattern on this name ... and with income. I've been holding this one for some time and was table pounding in the low $30s.

$QCMO - In retrospect, I should have taken the big move from my initial Phoenix purchase. Instead, I'm waiting to add another unit while waiting for news to light a fire under it and the rebirth of the Phoenix.

$RDDT - Coming and settling nicely. Not falling much any longer but basing out. I'm not ready to add more but would on 10% further weakness. This name has big upside when momentum turns. Just have to be patient.

$TGT - I keep looking to buy another unit but haven't pulled the trigger. It's a long term income play.

$UBER - One of my favorite stocks and I've been trading around my long position. It was also included in my big shopping day a couple weeks ago as I doubled up on the 2026 $70 Calls. Those are now very green but I'm looking for north of $80 on the stock before liquidating some or all of the position

$VIK - I'll be adding some at some point. Has been very strong in the upper $30s. Like the growth, like the valuation and like the support. Just waiting to see if I can get a discretionary spending dip which would hit travel/cruise stocks.

$VRT - I can make a case for VRT to be a ""Best Idea"" stock in my portfolio. I was loading up not long ago well below today's $73 price. I just want to build and hold this name for the long haul. Along with $VST, $VRT pops on nearly every screen I create for highlighting stocks with a combination of value + growth.

**Final Word**

The toughest thing for me has always been patience, which is why you will always hear me talk about it. 

As an investor with cash on the sidelines, I'm always looking for compelling purchases. But, at the same time, we have to realize that sometimes the economic underpinnings and or market psychology isn't right for entry. As we've seen recently, the markets can dive or leap all on an unplanned comment from Trump or his team. If I'm a believer that there's too much risk in the ""E"" of P/E then valuations can be called into question and that, then, impacts many of the metrics I look for before taking positions.

In cases like these, I don't look for a lot of new positions but, instead, on my existing holdings and the opportunity to reduce cost basis in them. I don't like buying high, and then buying lower but it's a strategy that has worked well in the past. This is why I preach patience .. and it has played out well over the past weeks.

We're still in the early innings of this new economic 'game' and it's likely to play out over the next two Qs of earnings reports. By that time, my hope is that we'll be well beyond tariffs as a primary daily discussion point and will, instead, be focused on a return of the fertile economic soil that we had before one man decided it was too fertile and needed to be amended. 

This too will past, but the timing is anything but certain. I remain cautious and largely unwilling to make any big bets, only minor adjustments.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (standard deviation of daily log returns) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatility (IV) of the option price. We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2025-05-30.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

11 April 2025 | Macro View  



🗞️ Context:  

We are observing early signals in 2025 that \*mirror\* key behavioural patterns from President Trump’s first term (2016-2020).  



Historical Pattern:  

During Trump's first presidency:  

🔻 Heavy selling pressure often dominated early week sessions (Mon-Wed).  

🔄 Markets consistently staged relief rallies into Thursday & Friday sessions.  

📉 However — this price action occurred within a \*larger bearish macro trend\* from 2016-2020, marked by trade wars, tariff escalation, and growing global uncertainty.  



Critical Breakdown:  

In 2020, the U.S. markets entered a terminal collapse zone during the Covid-19 pandemic — accelerating the final leg of the downtrend before central bank intervention fuelled an unprecedented liquidity-driven recovery.



🚨 2025 Echo Cycle?  

We are now observing \*similar early-stage behaviour\* under Trump's renewed influence:  

\- Aggressive trade posturing vs China 🇨🇳  

\- Tariff escalation arms race (125% China retaliatory tariff overnight)  

\- Increasing volatility early week — with bulls defending late week sessions  

\- Heavy Gold accumulation ($GC\_F at record highs) signalling global risk hedging  

\- Oil volatility + FX weakness signalling flight to safety  



📍 Emerging Risks:  

\- Potential escalation beyond economic warfare into military posturing or conflict.  

\- Fragile Treasury market with increasing sovereign debt risks.  

\- Global supply chain vulnerability re-exposed.  

\- Market structure vulnerable to rapid liquidation events.  



💡 Strategic Takeaways for Traders & Investors:  

\- Treat late-week rallies (Thurs-Fri) with caution — until market structure confirms bullish continuation.  

\- Watch $VIX compression and expansion closely — prime trigger for risk recalibration.  

\- Defensive Sectors: $GDX $NEM $GLD $XLV $XLP showing rotation.  

\- High-Beta Tech ($AAPL $TSLA $MSFT) remain rally leaders but subject to headline risk.  

\- Stay Cash Flexible — Pending high-impact news catalysts.  



Summary:  

History doesn’t repeat — but it often rhymes 🎵.  

We are witnessing the early stages of a \*Trump Trade War 2.0 Playbook\*.  

Volatility is opportunity — but requires discipline and patience.  



Prepare for elevated risk, defend capital, and position for potential crisis alpha.

# Options Trading Strategies

## Newmont Goldcorp (NEM): Bull Put Spread

### Rationale:
- NEM is trading at roughly $50.94 with a strong bullish trading signal of 2.71 and price action staying above key support (~$47).
- Its high implied volatility (≈61.6%) offers attractive premium for selling protection, and its technical setup indicates a potential rebound within a limited downside range.

### Strategy:
- **Structure**: Initiate a bull put spread using the near-term expiration on 2025-04-25.
- **Example Setup**: Sell a put at $48.00 and simultaneously buy a protective put at $46.50.
- This defined-risk credit spread benefits if NEM holds above the short-put strike.

### Key Metrics:
- **Maximum Loss**: Equal to the spread width minus the collected credit. For example, if you collect $0.80 premium, the max loss = (1.50 – 0.80) = $0.70 per share.
- **Maximum Profit**: Limited to the premium received (≈$0.80 per share).
- **Breakeven Point**: Approximately $48.00 – premium (≈$47.20).
- **Profit Target & Stop Loss**: Consider partial profit-taking if the spread's value erodes by 50-70% as time decay accelerates. If NEM breaches the key support area (near $47), aggressively exit to cap downside.

### Risk Assessment:
- Defined maximum loss controlled by the width of the spread; premium is robust due to high IV.
- The trade is sensitive to a steep move below support. Tight management is required if the price nears the breakeven or support levels, preserving capital in a volatile risk environment.

---

## Stride Inc (LRN): Bull Call Spread

### Rationale:
- LRN is posting strong momentum—a trading signal of 1.85 and a very high VRO of 67.11% indicate powerful bullish pressure.
- Trading at $133.74, it's already above its short-term averages, and a call spread will let you participate in the upside while limiting upfront cost.

### Strategy:
- **Structure**: Implement a bull call spread using the 2025-05-16 expiration.
- **Example Setup**: Buy an at-the-money call (around $135) and sell an out-of-the-money call (for example, $145).
- This spread limits your cost while capturing an estimated price move if LRN rallies further.

### Key Metrics:
- **Maximum Loss**: Equals the net debit paid. (If the debit is $2.00 per share, your max loss is $2.00/share.)
- **Maximum Profit**: The difference between strikes minus the debit; here roughly $10 – $2.00 = $8.00 per share.
- **Breakeven Point**: Approximately the lower strike plus the debit (e.g., $135 + $2.00 = $137.00).
- **Profit Target & Stop Loss**: Consider booking profits if the spread's value gains 50-70% of max profit. Discontinue the trade if the underlying fails to breach the breakeven within the first half of the expiration period.

### Risk Assessment:
- The debit is fully risked and represents a small fraction of capital, meeting the defined risk target.
- Time decay works against long calls; the spread's structure mitigates this risk while capping potential adverse moves.
- Rapid reversals in high-momentum stocks like LRN necessitate prompt exits if the price stalls or reverses before reaching breakeven.

---

## Trane Technologies (TT): Bull Put Spread

### Rationale:
- TT's price, currently around $338.33, is supported by solid technicals with a bullish trading signal of 2.00.
- Its current trading near long-term support and a moderate IV (≈50.4%) create an environment where a credit spread offers a controlled entry into an industrial recovery play.

### Strategy:
- **Structure**: Sell a bull put spread with the 2025-05-16 expiration.
- **Example Setup**: Sell a put at $330 and buy a lower-strike put at $320.
- This trade collects premium while defining risk if TT remains above the short-put strike.

### Key Metrics:
- **Maximum Profit**: Limited to the net credit received (for example, an assumed $4.00 per share).
- **Maximum Loss**: The difference in strike prices less the credit (here, $10 – $4.00 = $6.00 per share).
- **Breakeven Point**: Approximately $330 – the credit (around $326).
- **Profit Target & Stop Loss**: Aim to close the position if the premium decays to 50-70% of max potential profit; exit if TT approaches or drops below the breakeven point to preserve capital.

### Risk Assessment:
- The defined-risk structure caps losses relative to the strike difference.
- TT's industrial exposure means a break of key support (~$330) would quickly deteriorate the spread's value.
- Discipline is essential if the broader market shifts—if TT falls to near the breakeven, the trade should be exited to maintain adherence to your -5% risk metric.",bullish option strategies april nem lrn tt,find helpful spot flaw appreciate effortplease upvote comment share options trading strategies newmont goldcorp nem bull put spread rationale nem trading roughly strong bullish trading signal price action staying key support high implied volatility offers attractive premium selling protection technical setup indicates potential rebound within limited downside range strategy structure initiate bull put spread using nearterm expiration example setup sell put simultaneously buy protective put definedrisk credit spread benefits nem holds shortput strike key metrics maximum loss equal spread width minus collected credit example collect premium max loss per share maximum profit limited premium received per share breakeven point approximately premium profit target stop loss consider partial profittaking spreads value erodes time decay accelerates nem breaches key support area near aggressively exit cap downside risk assessment defined maximum loss controlled width spread premium robust due high iv trade sensitive steep move support tight management required price nears breakeven support levels preserving capital volatile risk environment stride inc lrn bull call spread rationale lrn posting strong momentuma trading signal high vro indicate powerful bullish pressure trading already shortterm averages call spread let participate upside limiting upfront cost strategy structure implement bull call spread using expiration example setup buy atthemoney call around sell outofthemoney call example spread limits cost capturing estimated price move lrn rallies key metrics maximum loss equals net debit paid debit per share max loss share maximum profit difference strikes minus debit roughly per share breakeven point approximately lower strike plus debit eg profit target stop loss consider booking profits spreads value gains max profit discontinue trade underlying fails breach breakeven within first half expiration period risk assessment debit fully risked represents small fraction capital meeting defined risk target time decay works long calls spreads structure mitigates risk capping potential adverse moves rapid reversals highmomentum stocks like lrn necessitate prompt exits price stalls reverses reaching breakeven trane technologies tt bull put spread rationale tts price currently around supported solid technicals bullish trading signal current trading near longterm support moderate iv create environment credit spread offers controlled entry industrial recovery play strategy structure sell bull put spread expiration example setup sell put buy lowerstrike put trade collects premium defining risk tt remains shortput strike key metrics maximum profit limited net credit received example assumed per share maximum loss difference strike prices less credit per share breakeven point approximately credit around profit target stop loss aim close position premium decays max potential profit exit tt approaches drops breakeven point preserve capital risk assessment definedrisk structure caps losses relative strike difference tts industrial exposure means break key support would quickly deteriorate spreads value discipline essential broader market shiftsif tt falls near breakeven trade exited maintain adherence risk metric,1.0,,['NEM'],neutral,0.9999991655349731,neutral,0.9980365633964539

1jpuwzw,InnerCircleInvesting,Market Digest: T-4 Hours (tariffs),"Happy Wednesday all. If nothing else, we're gong to get the next clue as we try to solve the tariff puzzle. But we have to wait until 4:00 PM EST.

**Liberation Day**

A good rally ahead of the announcement and, to me, it's pointless. One of the Halftime Traders (Joe T.) said very well what I've been feeling. Essentially: *How can you make a confident case either way as to what to expect in the future as it relates to the economy related to tariffs?*

I agree with that wholeheartedly. And, in that same vein, I'm not sure how the markets can maintain this rally into the close and I expect a whole lot of flat as the last trades take place ahead of the announcement. What follows Trump's announcement is anyone's guess ... and a guess it is.

I look up and down my watchlist and I can't confidently buy a single issue with any level of confidence. I might be able to get behind a purchase of pure momentum and speculation names that have come down in the recent week, such as $QMCO $ACHR $LUNR $QBTS $RGTI, etc.

The worst case scenario in my estimation would be a blanket tariff of 20% on all imports, augmented by reciprocal tariffs if/when other countries respond. Thus, 20% being the base case.

Should he kick the can down the road, extending the deadline on tariffs, markets should rally. In the absence of anything new or more rhetoric about a level of permanence or expansionary potential and I think the markets are going to be pulled down. It seems to me that the market has digested the existence and expectations of ongoing tariffs and will no longer be wholly impacted by their existence. Instead, focus will be turned to the impact of them as it relates to recession and/or stagflaton.

If at any point these tariffs are seen as truly transitory and limited in scope/time, the markets should be in fully rally mode and you'll need to consider engaging in your own buy program. The one thing I would caution you all to consider is that the tariffs have already has an impact, will continue to impact and this will show up in future earnings reports. That is the fly in the market and economic ointment going forward. 

**Random Shots**

I was going to do a longer recap of many stocks/names but it just doesn't make sense given what is to come. Doesn't matter because it could all turn on a dime a few hours from now. But let's do a short list of some interesting things I'm seeing.

$NVDA  - Showing uncertainty into the tariff announcement and rising only modestly. I still say that the analysts citing growth concerns, unit sales, competition, less spend, etc. have forgotten that we're in no more than the 2nd inning of the AI era, probably still the 1st.

AI Energy - A lot of continuing discussion that not was much power will be required. That is so shortsighted IMO that it's laughable. Somehow analysts have stopped looking at the legs of the AI trade and, instead, focusing on what the micro environment will be in 2025 only.

$AVGO - Continues to be one of my top builds and interesting that it is decoupled with NVDA today.

$ANET - I still think this is a screaming buy for the future and I'm in 2026 $80 Calls. It's not as well valued as some of the other names but close enough and in a great spot for growth. Hedge funds and analysts love this play.

$AMZN - So confident in my reentries into this position. Now looks like they are bidding to TikTok

$DECK - Finally catching a bid but it needs to hold and rally past $118. Waiting to add one more U

$EIX - Finally looking to break back above $60

$CLF -That weakness down to $8 is crazy and all tariff related. Would love to double up but focusing on other names

$QMCO - Coming back into view for additional shares, though I still prefer closer to $10. Could have taken that near-double but holding for the big Phoenix move.

$UBER - Keep waiting for the run and think it will happen soon back above $80

**Final Word**

As I finish this, the word is that the expectation is that the tariffs are going to be very negotiable with a slant toward the short term. If that is the case, we should continue to rally. I'm intrigued though hardly confident. I'm going to survey my names once more to determine if three's anything to buy but with a strong lean toward sitting on my hands. I don't like the fact that the administration is still in the process of determining what they are trying to accomplish ahead of the 4:00 PM talk. If there is that much indecision heading into the discussion, imagine what is to come following the decision and response from other nations.

There's a lot of beta to come here.

Link: [Gotion 314Ah 3.2V prismatic](https://www.docanpower.com/cn-stock-ev-es-grade-a-gotion-lf314-340ah-lifepo4-battery-cell-3-2v-prismatic-welded-m6-studs)

This is the quote I received:  
Gotion 314Ah LiFePO4 cell (32 cells) + DDP = US$2,039

Nothing comes close to giving me 30kwh at that price. I’m wanting to put them together into a 16S2P configuration, 48V in my RV for full-time boondocking. Potentially expand to 16S3P in the future if needed. Axle weight is more of a limiter at that point haha.

I've been lurking in the forums, I know Docan can be hit-or-miss. This is my first foray into DIY solar, and my first large purchase. I’ve been doing my own research for weeks, but I’m at the point of information overload from watching long Youtube reviews (that I'm so grateful for).

**Questions:**  
\- What should I realistically expect from these ""A-minus cells"" performance-wise. I'm not looking for capacity perfection, but also don't want bloated/damaged cells.  
\- Should I order extra cells, or a proper battery charger for initial top balancing?  
\- What should I ask for re the cells/shipping? The quote does not include any test reports.

**Holistically:**  
It’s my first time, I don’t need perfection. I’m going to have fun putting these together and learning more about DIY batteries. I want to learn how to test cells and monitor their performance over time. But I mainly want to hook up into my RV, and hit the road, and don’t want to spend 3 extra months arguing with a seller.

Thanks for any advice!",gotion ah lifepo cells legit,edit shipping canada us tarrifs apply sorry lack clarity link gotion ah v prismatichttpswwwdocanpowercomcnstockevesgradeagotionlfahlifepobatterycellvprismaticweldedmstuds links bloghttpswwwdocanpowercomblogandfeedbackscatlahvsgotionah youtubehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdwytaamuykts quote received gotion ah lifepo cell cells ddp us nothing comes close giving kwh price im wanting put together sp configuration v rv fulltime boondocking potentially expand sp future needed axle weight limiter point haha ive lurking forums know docan hitormiss first foray diy solar first large purchase ive research weeks im point information overload watching long youtube reviews im grateful questions realistically expect aminus cells performancewise im looking capacity perfection also dont want bloateddamaged cells order extra cells proper battery charger initial top balancing ask cellsshipping quote include test reports holistically first time dont need perfection im going fun putting together learning diy batteries want learn test cells monitor performance time mainly want hook rv hit road dont want spend extra months arguing seller thanks advice,0.72,,['FE'],negative,0.9998044371604919,negative,0.9999068975448608

1k1lojf,TheCowboyBunkhouse,RODEO RISING: PRORODEO REACHING NEW HEIGHTS AND AUDIENCES,"Alex Riley, Special to PRORODEO Sports News

Apr 16, 2025


While it might seem simple to credit Taylor Sheridan and his *Yellowstone* universe for the increased interest in Western culture and rodeo, it's certainly a place to start the conversation.

The show premiered in 2018, spawning two currently airing spinoffs and a third that is still in production.

Even though it's a fictional story, the drama has been credited for shining a fairly authentic and accurate light on ranch life and the American West, providing a glimpse into the experience.

""There is that *Yellowstone* effect. People talk about it, and it is real,"" said Teton Ridge CEO Deidre Lester. ""As someone who comes from the East Coast, everyone was watching that series and it shined a light back on ranch life, the middle of America that you don't always see highlighted in Hollywood movies and televisions shows. So, that definitely drew a lot of interest from sort of a casual, what we call, 'the cowboy curious' audience.""

Seeing the action unfold on a screen is one thing. Experiencing it is another.

""Sadly, the pandemic was awful, but it also woke people up to wanting to be outside, wanting to be outdoors, experiencing getting back to being out in the world,"" Lester continued. ""And I think rodeo is a great representation of that. I do think that rodeo also hung in there during the pandemic. There were some changes that had to happen to accommodate what was going on in Las Vegas, I know, but at the same time rodeo marched on and I think that was important as well. And I think that that drew a lot of people in that maybe were reconnecting with the sport.""

John Travolta sparked a craze in the 1980s. In the 1990s, it was almost impossible to go a day without hearing ""Friends in Low Places"" on the radio. Today's popularity push is credited to a catalog of shows about the Dutton family, both now and in the past.

Longstanding and loyal fans have always been there when it comes to PRORODEO. Lately, they're being joined by a plethora of new faces.

Attendance records at numerous events, both big and small, have been reset in the last several years. Additionally, viewership of The Cowboy Channel, the rodeo and western-specific cable network and streaming service, has seen significant upticks. In 2023, the network saw a 64 percent increase in viewership compared to 2022 during its annual ""100 Rodeos in 100 Days"" event.

It's a pattern that shows passion for the western way of life continues to be on the rise. But why? And more importantly, what's next?

##Money talks

Money may grow on trees. But for many PRCA rodeos, it's made on the backs of stock, more frequently in large arenas.

RodeoHouston, the top regular season rodeo in the PRCA, concluded March 23 after paying out more than $2.5 million in earnings. Winning contestants walked away with a record $65,000, which all counts in the PRCA | Bill Fick Ford World Standings.

The rodeo has become a must-compete event for athletes, with winnings that large helping them qualify for the coveted 2025 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo presented by Teton Ridge in Las Vegas.

But Houston has become more than just a rodeo. It's become a spectacle, and a great one at that. Nightly concerts for more than 70,000 fans all packed into the Houston Texans' NRG Stadium has further increased the excitement for rodeo – or at the very least putting more money and eyes onto it.

But Houston isn't alone in providing cowboys with huge rodeo pay days. The state of Utah has become a gold mine for potential NFR qualifiers.

Every July the State of Utah celebrates Pioneer Week the third week of July with the culmination of the celebration being July 24, marking the day when Brigham Young and a determined company of Mormon pioneers realized their dreams upon entering the Great Salt Valley. Rodeo has long played a part during this celebration with the Utah Days of '47 Rodeo, the Spanish Fork Fiesta Days Rodeo and the Ogden Pioneer Days all being contested during this time.

In 2023, these three PRCA rodeos joined together to offer nearly $2 million in payouts– all happening within a 5-day span and within a 100-miles of each other. In addition to these record payouts during Pioneer Week in Utah, there was an additional bonus of $15,000 for the top earning female and male athlete each across these three rodeos.

This program continued in 2024 with barrel racer Kassie Mowry leading the way on the female side winning an astonishing $37,172 at the three Utah rodeos during that week and Marty Yates was the top male performing athlete with $29,786.

##Reaching a wider audience

Whether playing at home or away, on any given weekend, an NFL fan can turn on a channel and find their favorite team. Same for most college programs or major professional sports leagues.

But for rodeo fans, keeping track of the cowboys and cowgirls they saw compete in their community could be difficult. In the past, once they left town, the only way to monitor their exploits was through written or online coverage of events across the country.

The Cowboy Channel changed that.

Established in 2017 on the vision of the late Patrick Gottsch, The Cowboy Channel sought to make western sports and lifestyle coverage mainstream. In less than a decade, it has transformed the rodeo experience, turning an often-isolated sport into an easy-to-follow year-round competition playing 24/7.

And that expansion, already at a rapid pace, shows little signs of slowing.

""I think rodeo has the potential to grow huge because of media. As we've seen, The Cowboy Channel started a wonderful thing and now it's our time to help expand that past the starting point,"" said Leon Vick, Vice President of Rodeo, Horse and Livestock Operations at the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo in Denver.

""You know, everybody has a starting point but then it's your job to take that a little bit further. Media, I don't want to say it's the last frontier, but it's our next frontier. I think rodeo has a lot of growth room.""

Weeks prior to the 2024 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, it was announced that Teton Ridge, a collection of companies that focus solely on western lifestyle and entertainment, had acquired The Cowboy Channel and all properties with Rural Media Group.

The goal has been simple – bring rodeo to the widest audience possible. That dream continues to become reality.

""I think first and foremost, with the acquisition of The Cowboy Channel, my vision is to get The Cowboy Channel in every home in America,"" Lester said. ""It's currently distributed in 25 million homes via satellite TV primarily and there's an opportunity to really take a fresh look at the distribution both linear but also the (over-the-top) and streaming apps and just make it more available to people. And then we're also looking at investing in the top rodeos that draw the largest audience and the biggest star power from an athlete's perspective for money prizes.""

##The format shift 

Creating something that's easy to understand was always Rorey Lemmel's goal.

As General Manager of the Governor's Cup, Lemmel drew on his own experience as a rodeo competitor when helping build the format for how the Cinch Playoffs would shape PRORODEO's regular season finish.

""From a former contestant, we always thought rodeo needed to be on a bigger stage and to be set up to be fan friendly,"" Lemmel said. ""Not everybody understands the cowboy way of multiple performances, and multiple times and town in-and-out. But this is an event where people can understand it. A winner each night and the best guys in the world. Essentially, I wanted to bring the NFC/AFC championships somewhere and luckily, I had a governor (in South Dakota) who believed in it.""

Established in 2023, the regular season-culminating event brings together the top four finishers from the Cinch Playoffs at the Puyallup (Wash.) Rodeo along with the top eight from each event in the PRCA Playoff Series Standings.

The addition of the Cinch Playoffs has reshaped the approach to competition and who has the potential to occupy the top spots going into Las Vegas.

The Governor's Cup in Sioux Falls, S.D., features a $1.3 million purse that has the potential to take a middle-of-the-pack competitor and turn them into a bonafide contender overnight.

NFR will always be the goal, but a visit to the Cinch Playoffs has become nearly a required steppingstone to get there. Of the 96 Cinch Playoff qualifiers in 2024, 82 went on to compete at NFR.

""Obviously, I don't know that anybody can duplicate the NFR experience, but I've been to that rodeo too. The Governor's Cup is just a hands down very well run production,"" longtime team roper Kollin VonAhn said after he and teammate Andrew Ward won the event last September. ""Honestly, I'm at the age now where I'm grateful for the opportunities that I get, and I was just glad to be there and experience it. But it was a first-class event, just unbelievable. If you never got to go to the NFR but you got to go to the Governor's Cup, you got a pretty damn good taste of what some of the best rodeo in the world is like.""

What happens in Sioux Falls during the final week of the regular season is a reflection of how the entire sport has changed in recent years. While there are still plenty of rodeos who follow the traditional format of a single go or multiple goes with an average championship, many of the bigger events have pivoted to tournament style brackets where competitors must do well enough in initial rounds for the opportunity to keep competing.

These changes have made it easier for fans to track who is still alive and who is in the running for a championship.

It's also made things a bit more lucrative.

""What's really important and really helped drive the sponsorships is if you look around at all the rodeos that are growing, one it's either a new facility and or it is the format change,"" Vick said. ""I know the contestants don't like to embrace the format changes that have happened, but they have to stop and look at the correlation between format change and the payout.""

##The numbers game

To be fair, Vick has lined up behind the barrier.

A former steer wrestler who qualified for a pair of NFRs over the course of his two-decade career, the Colorado native knows what it takes to be among the best in PRORODEO. Albeit his run was at a slightly different point in history.

Not that long ago, a rodeo competitor had a good shot at securing a qualifying spot at NFR with around $50,000 in earnings over the course of an entire season. Now, there are opportunities to earn that same amount from one rodeo in a span of days.

""I come out of the rodeo world. I won Cheyenne. I won Houston. I won under $15,000 at both of those rodeos when I won them. Which, hey, I'm not knocking them. That was a lot of money, and it still is,"" Vick said. ""But today, you end up winning those rodeos and you're going to leave with $50,000. What's the big change? Format.""

Tournament style brackets. The Cinch Playoffs. Increased attention to the sport itself. All of it has added up to make rodeo a more compelling draw for fans and sponsors. Ticket sales continue to rise and brand deals with both traditional and new advertisers have altered the landscape. The result – staggering numbers that would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago.

In 2024, every NFR qualifier in bareback riding, team roping, saddle bronc riding, tie-down roping, barrel racing and bull riding had cleared more than $100,000 in earnings before the Finals started, while nine of the 15 steer wrestlers had reached the benchmark.

In fact, going into NFR last December, 22 total competitors had already eclipsed $200,000 in earnings that season. By comparison, a decade earlier, 10 competitors needed NFR success to finish 2014 with more than $200,000 in total earnings for the season.

""I think I won $50,000 (in 2023), but it was kind of an eye-opener for me of how rodeo had changed,"" VonAhn said after returning to the PRCA full-time last season. ""About 2015, right in there, it would take mid-$60,000 to make the NFR. Fast-forward, now it's taking over $100,000. Well, that's a big difference. It dawned on me that you've got to have big opportunities on big stages if you think you're just going to make the Finals.""

Bigger payouts. Larger crowds. More media exposure. Increased awareness. PRORODEO's continued growth is rapid and ongoing.

While there are plenty of advancements to navigate, the sport's foundation remains unchanged. At its core, it is still reliant on a cowboy or cowgirl nodding their head, aiming for that perfect run or ride.

But with more eyes watching and money invested, the reach of the western lifestyle is only getting bigger. And that's a situation everyone is excited about.

""The thing I saw was that there really is a very large and very loyal fan base here, and that the athletes are truly some of the best remarkable athletes in the world or sports. And it's just not necessarily been given the mainstream sports media attention that it deserves,"" Lester said. ""To me, there's just a big opportunity here to put rodeo on a bigger stage with a national broadcast, to showcase the stars of the sport. And it's also a space that really has been overlooked by major marketing and brand advertisers with a community of fans that are as loyal as almost anything I've seen anywhere else.

""So, I just think there's a lot of room for growth here and so we're looking forward to pushing it forward.""

1jv6eri,RocketLeagueEsports,"RLFS S4 [Swiss - Round 1]: The Three Carries [Seikoo, Oski, frosty] vs. DraliiBalli [dralii, Juicy, reveal]","# Rocket League Fantasy Series (RLFS) - Season 4

The Rocket League Fantasy Series (RLFS) is a 16-team Rocket League Tournament, where RL players have been fantasy-drafted to teams by users of this subreddit. The RLFS uses reddit polls to determine the odds each team has of winning the series through a weighted-voting system, and then simulates the outcome of the series using these odds and a Random Number Generator.

For this season the RLFS tournament will be a Swiss Bracket (that follows Buchholz score), and which ultimately leads to a final-bracket to determine our champion.

Teams were drafted before the first regionals were played, and you can view the results of the draft, the rosters of all RLFS teams, and our schedule for the RLFS tournament in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vW14kP91FdCJZ6tGngxHiaW2bQp69sCEYTilyscQkM/edit?usp=sharing).

# Swiss - Round 1 - Game 5

# The Three Carries

**Roster:**

[**Seikoo**](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Seikoo)

[**Oski**](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Oski)

[**Frosty**](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Frosty)

**GM Message:**

>Dralii is a monster but let's be real, this shouldn’t be close. One great player vs three great players. And if you’re thinking “Frosty is great, what?” then you need to invest in his stock ASAP and go actually watch him play. Guy has leveled up hugely this split and deserves better teammates. There’s a reason he has been instantly snapped up by a LAN team. He is a mechanical \*monster\* who has literally 1v3ed NRG \*and\* The Ultimates at times this season.

>And then there’s Seikoo, the flip-reset merchant himself who remains easily a top-5 defensive carry in the game and Oski who is one of the best in the world still in both attack and defence.

>Against them are two guys who were, let’s face it, firmly in the backpack this split. Juicy remains inconsistent as hell and Reveal is almost the opposite – solid, but just doesn’t have the ceiling to compete with the top mechanical talents – which my team boasts three of. In addition to that, all three players are dead last on their teams for defensive work. They’re going to concede a crapload of goals because they all need somebody enabling them and covering for them to function. Dralii is the only one on the team even capable and that’s a waste of his talents.

>This team has mechanics for days coupled with the perfect balance in Seikoo who is a peak defensive carry, a world-class all-action superstar with Oski and terrifying attacking phenom in Frosty.

# DraliiBalli

**Roster:**

[**dralii**](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Dralii)

[**Juicy**](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Juicy)

[**reveal**](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Reveal)

**GM Message:**

>The gameplan is as simple as the team name: Dralii go balli. He may not be flanked by the likes of Vatira or Atow but his new squad is no slouches either. It may have been a rough split for gentlemates but Seikoo clearly hasn’t given up on Juicy and neither will I. A Top 8 at worlds, Top 4 in London, and Top 1 with MVP honors in Copenhagen is nothing to scoff and and with Dralii by his side he’s looking to get back to that. And as for Reveal? Well who better to help a new rookie reach the top than two players who are perfect examples in recent times? The man who’d no doubt be considered the best player on SSG if he had the same PR as the others, this is a young squad with winning ways and they’re looking to take on the RLFS with style.

# Assumptions for Voting

\- Assume that all players are capable of communicating with each other using a universal language.

\- Assume that the matchups are being played in a LAN environment with a crowd present.

# Weighted Voting System

The RLFS uses a weighted-voting system to determine per-game odds. The votes will be weighted as follows:

Team X to win the series 3-0 against Team Y: 1.0 vote to Team X  
Team X to win the series 3-1 against Team Y: 0.75 votes to Team X, 0.25 votes to Team Y  
Team X to win the series 3-2 against Team Y: 0.6 votes to Team X, 0.4 votes to Team Y

Is [https://www.nrg.ro/](https://www.nrg.ro/) a legit site? I'm trying to get a replica that's out of stock everywhere else inside EU and (according to their website) they still have a few of those in stock. I've tried contacting them over email, Instagram, Facebook and got no answer over any of those channels.

The website seems to be getting updated regularly, but I'm kind of worried about the complete radio silence.

Does anyone know whether they ship airsoft replicas inside the EU?
